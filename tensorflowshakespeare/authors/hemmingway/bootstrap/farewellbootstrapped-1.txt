CHAPTER I
In the late summer of that year we lived in a house
in a village that looked across the river and the plain to
the mountains In the bed of the river there were peb
bles and boulders dry and white in the sun and the
water was clear and swiftly moving and blue in the
channels Troops went by the house and down the road
and the dust they raised powdered the leaves of the
trees The trunks of the trees too were dusty and the
leaves fell early that year and we saw the troops march
ing along the road and the dust rising and leaves stirred
by the breeze falling and the soldiers marching and
afterward the road bare and white except for the leaves
The plain was rich with crops there were many
orchards of fruit trees and beyond the plain the moun
tains were brown and bare There was fighting in the
mountains and at night we could see the flashes from
the artillery In the dark it was like summer lightning
but the nights were cool and there was not the feeling
of a storm coming
Sometimes in the dark we heard the troops marching
under the window and guns going past pulled by motor
tractors There was much traffic at night and many
mules on the roads with boxes of ammunition on each
side of their packsaddles and gray motortrucks that
carried men and other trucks with loads covered with
canvas that moved slower in the traffic There were big
guns too that passed in the day drawn by tractors the
long barrels of the guns covered with green branches
and green leafy branches and vines laid over the trac
tors To the north we could look across a valley and see
a forest of chestnut trees and behind it another moun
tain on this side of the river There was fighting for
that mountain too but it was not successful and in the
fall when the rains came the leaves all fell from the
chestnut trees and the branches were bare and the trunks
black with rain The vineyards were thin and bare
branched too and all the country wet and brown and
dead with the autumn There were mists over the river
and clouds on the mountain and the trucks splashed
mud on the road and the troops were muddy and wet
in their capes their rifles were wet and under their
capes the two leather cartridgeboxes on the front of
the belts gray leather boxes heavy with the packs of
clips of thin long 65 mm cartridges bulged forward
under the capes so that the men passing on the road
marched as though they were six months gone with
child
There were small gray motorcars that passed going
very fast  usually there was an officer on the seat with
the driver and more officers in the back seat They
splashed more mud than the camions even and if one of
the officers in the back was very small and sitting be
tween two generals he himself so small that you could
not see his face but only the top of his cap and his nar
row back and if the car went especially fast it was
probably the King He lived in Udine and came out in
this way nearly every day to see how things were going
and things went very badly
At the start of the winter came the permanent rain
and with the rain came the cholera But it was checked
and in the end only seven thousand died of it in the
army
CHAPTER II
The next year there were many victories The
mountain that was beyond the valley and the hillside
where the chestnut forest grew was captured and there
were victories beyond the plain on the plateau to the
south and we crossed the river in August and lived in a
house in Gorizia that had a fountain and many thick
shady trees in a walled garden and a wistaria vine
purple on the side of the house Now the fighting was
in the next mountains beyond and was not a mile away
The town was very nice and our house was very fine
The river ran behind us and the town had been cap
tured very handsomely but the mountains beyond it
could not be taken and I was very glad the Austrians
seemed to want to come back to the town some time if
the war should end because they did not bombard it to
destroy it but only a little in a military way People
lived on in it and there were hospitals and cafes and
artillery up side streets and two bawdy houses one for
troops and one for officers and with the end of the
summer the cool nights the fighting in the mountains
beyond the town the shellmarked iron of the railway
bridge the smashed tunnel by the river where the fight
ing had been the trees around the square and the long
avenue of trees that led to the square these with there
being girls in the town the King passing in his motor
car sometimes now seeing his face and little long
necked body and gray beard like a goats chin tuft  all
these with the sudden interiors of houses that had lost a
wall through shelling with plaster and rubble in their
gardens and sometimes in the street and the whole thing
s
going well on the Carso made the fall very different
from the last fall when we had been in the country
The war was changed too
The forest of oak trees on the mountain beyond the
town was gone The forest had been green in the
summer when we had come into the town but now there
were the stumps and the broken trunks and the ground
torn up and one day at the end of the fall when I was
out where the oak forest had been I saw a cloud com
ing over the mountain It came very fast and the sun
went a dull yellow and then everything was gray and
the sky was covered and the cloud came on down the
mountain and suddenly we were in it and it was snow
The snow slanted across the wind the bare ground was
covered the stumps of trees projected there was snow
on the guns and there were paths in the snow going
back to the latrines behind trenches
Later below in the town I watched the snow falling
looking out of the window of the bawdy house the
house for officers where I sat with a friend and two
glasses drinking a bottle of Asti and looking out at the
snow falling slowly and heavily we knew it was all
over for that year Up the river the mountains had not
been taken  none of the mountains beyond the river had
been taken That was all left for next year My friend
saw the priest from our mess going by in the street
walking carefully in the slush and pounded on the win
dow to attract his attention The priest looked up He
saw us and smiled My friend motioned for him to
come in The priest shook his head and went on That
night in the mess after the spaghetti course which
every one ate very quickly and seriously lifting the
spaghetti on the fork until the loose strands hung clear
then lowering it into the mouth or else using a con
tinuous lift and sucking into the mouth helping our
selves to wine from the grasscovered gallon flask it
swung in a metal cradle and you pulled the neck of the
flask down with the forefinger and the wine cg ar red
tannic and lovely poured out into the glass held with
the same hand after this course the captain com
menced picking on the priest
The priest was young and blushed easily and wore a
uniform like the rest of us but with a cross in dark
red velvet above the left breast pocket of his gray
tunic The captain spoke pidgin Italian for my doubt
ful benefit in order that I might understand perfectly
that nothing should be lost
Priest today with girls the captain said looking at
the priest and at me The priest smiled and blushed and
shook his head This captain baited him often
Not true asked the captain Today I see priest
with girls
No said the priest The other officers were
amused at the baiting
Priest not with girls went on the captain Priest
never with girls he explained to me He took my
glass and filled it looking at my eyes all the time but
not losing sight of the priest
Priest every night five against one Every one at
the table laughed You understand  Priest every night
five against one He made a gesture and laughed
loudly The priest accepted it as a joke
The Pope wants the Austrians to win the war the
major said He loves Franz Joseph Thats where
the money comes from I am an atheist
Did you ever read the Black Pig  asked the lieu
tenant I will get you a copy It was that which
shook my faith
It is a filthy and vile book said the priest You
do not really like it
It is very valuable said the lieutenant It tells you
about those priests You will like it he said to me I
smiled at the priest and he smiled back across the candle
light Dont you read it he said
I will get it for you said the lieutenant
All thinking men are atheists the major said I
do not believe in the Free Masons however
I believe in the Free Masons the lieutenant said
It is a noble organization Some one came in and
as the door opened I could see the snow falling
There will be no more offensive now that the snow
has come I said
Certainly not said the major You should go on
leave You should go to Rome Naples Sicily 
He should visit Amalfi said the lieutenant I
will write you cards to my family in Amalfi They will
love you like a son
He should go to Palermo
He ought to go to Capri
I would like you to see Abruzzi and visit my family
at Capracotta said the priest
Listen to him talk about the Abruzzi Theres more
snow there than here He doesnt want to see peasants
Let him go to centres of culture and civilization
He should have fine girls I will give you the ad
dresses of places in Naples Beautiful young girls  ac
companied by their mothers Ha  Ha  Ha  The cap
tain spread his hand open the thumb up and fingers
outspread as when you make shadow pictures There
was a shadow from his hand on the wall He spoke
again in pidgin Italian You go away like this he
pointed to the thumb and come back like this he
touched the little finger Every one laughed
Look said the captain He spread the hand again
Again the candlelight made its shadows on the wall
He started with the upright thumb and named in their
order the thumb and four fingers sototenente the
thumb tenente first finger capitano next finger
maggiore next to the little finger and tenentecolo
nello the little finger You go away sototenente
You come back sotocolonello  They all laughed The
captain was having a great success with finger games
He looked at the priest and shouted Every night
priest five against one  They all laughed again
You must go on leave at once the major said
I would like to go with you and show you things
the lieutenant said
When you come back bring a phonograph
Bring good opera disks
Bring Caruso
Dont bring Caruso He bellows
Dont you wish you could bellow like him
He bellows I say he bellows 
I would like you to go to Abruzzi the priest said
The others were shouting There is good hunting
You would like the people and though it is cold it is
clear and dry You could stay with my family My
father is a famous hunter
Come on said the captain We go whorehouse be
fore it shuts
Good night I said to the priest
Good night he said
CHAPTER III
When I came back to the front we still lived in that
town There were many more guns in the country
around and the spring had come The fields were green
and there were small green shoots on the vines the trees
along the road had small leaves and a breeze came from
the sea I saw the town with the hill and the old castle
above it in a cup in the hills with the mountains beyond
brown mountains with a little green on their slopes In
the town there were more guns there were some new
hospitals you met British men and sometimes women
on the street and a few more houses had been hit by
shell fire It was warm and like the spring and I
walked down the alleyway of trees warmed from the
sun on the wall and found we still lived in the same
house and that it all looked the same as when I had left
it The door was open there was a soldier sitting on a
bench outside in the sun an ambulance was waiting by
the side door and inside the door as I went in there
was the smell of marble floors and hospital It was all
as I had left it except that now it was spring I looked
in the door of the big room and saw the major sitting
at his desk the window open and the sunlight coming
into the room He did not see me and I did not know
whether to go in and report or go upstairs first and
clean up I decided to go on upstairs
The room I shared with the lieutenant Rinaldi looked
out on the courtyard The window was open my bed
was made up with blankets and my things hung on the
wall the gas mask in an oblong tin can the steel helmet
on the same peg At the foot of the bed was my flat
IO
trunk and my winter boots the leather shiny with oil
were on the trunk My Austrian snipers rifle with its
blued octagon barrel and the lovely dark walnut cheek
fitted schutzen stock hung over the two beds The
telescope that fitted it was I remembered locked in the
trunk The lieutenant Rinaldi lay asleep on the other
bed He woke when he heard me in the room and sat
up
Ciaou he said What kind of time did you
have
Magnificent
We shook hands and he put his arm around my neck
and kissed me
Oughf I said
Youre dirty he said You ought to wash
Where did you go and what did you do  Tell me every
thing at once
I went everywhere Milan Florence Rome Naples
Villa San Giovanni Messina Taormina 
You talk like a timetable Did you have any beau
tiful adventures
Yes
Where
Milano Firenze Roma Napoli 
Thats enough Tell me really what was the best
In Milano
That was because it was first Where did you meet
her  In the Cova  Where did you go  How did you
feel Tell me everything at once Did you stay all
night
Yes
Thats nothing Here now we have beautiful girls
New girls never been to the front before
Wonderful
You dont believe me We will go now this after
noon and see And in the town we have beautiful
English girls I am now in love with Miss Barkley
I will take you to call I will probably marry Miss
Barkley
I have to get washed and report Doesnt anybody
work now
Since you are gone we have nothing but frostbites
chilblains jaundice gonorrhea selfinflicted wounds
pneumonia and hard and soft chancres Every week
some one gets wounded by rock fragments There are
a few real wounded Next week the war starts again
Perhaps it starts again They say so Do you think I
would do right to marry Miss Barkley  after the war
of course
Absolutely I said and poured the basin full of
water
Tonight you will tell me everything said Rinaldi
Now I must go back to sleep to be fresh and beautiful
for Miss Barkley
I took off my tunic and shirt and washed in the cold
water in the basin While I rubbed myself with a towel
I looked around the room and out the window and at
Rinaldi lying with his eyes closed on the bed He was
goodlooking was my age and he came from Amalfi
He loved being a surgeon and we were great friends
While I was looking at him he opened his eyes
Have you any money
Yes
Loan me fifty lire
I dried my hands and took out my pocketbook from
the inside of my tunic hanging on the wall Rinaldi
took the note folded it without rising from the bed and
slid it in his breeches pocket He smiled I must make
on Miss Barkley the impression of a man of sufficient
wealth You are my great and good friend and finan
cial protector
Go to hell I said
That night at the mess I sat next to the priest and he
was disappointed and suddenly hurt that I had not gone
to the Abruzzi He had written to his father that I was
coming and they had made preparations I myself felt
as badly as he did and could not understand why I had
not gone It was what I had wanted to do and I tried
to explain how one thing had led to another and finally
he saw it and understood that I had really wanted to go
and it was almost all right I had drunk much wine
and afterward coffee and Strega and I explained wine
fully how we did not do the things we wanted to do 
we never did such things
We two were talking while the others argued I had
wanted to go to Abruzzi I had gone to no place where
the roads were frozen and hard as iron where it was
clear cold and dry and the snow was dry and powdery
and haretracks in the snow and the peasants took off
their hats and called you Lord and there was good hunt
ing I had gone to no such place but to the smoke of
cafes and nights when the room whirled and you needed
to look at the wall to make it stop nights in bed drunk
when you knew that that was all there was and the
strange excitement of waking and not knowing who it
was with you and the world all unreal in the dark and
so exciting that you must resume again unknowing and
not caring in the night sure that this was all and all
and all and not caring Suddenly to care very much
and to sleep to wake with it sometimes morning and all
that had been there gone and everything sharp and hard
and clear and sometimes a dispute about the cost
i 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS
Sometimes still pleasant and fond and warm and break
fast and lunch Sometimes all niceness gone and glad
to get out on the street but always another day starting
and then another night I tried to tell about the night
and the difference between the night and the day and
how the night was better unless the day was very clean
and cold and I could not tell it  as I cannot tell it now
But if you have had it you know He had not had it
but he understood that I had really wanted to go to the
Abruzzi but had not gone and we were still friends
with many tastes alike but with the difference between
us He had always known what I did not know and
what when I learned it I was always able to forget
But I did not know that then although I learned it later
In the meantime we were all at the mess the meal was
finished and the argument went on We two stopped
talking and the captain shouted Priest not happy
Priest not happy without girls
I am happy said the priest
Priest not happy Priest wants Austrians to win
the war the captain said The others listened The
priest shook his head
No he said
Priest wants us never to attack Dont you want us
never to attack
No If there is a war I suppose we must attack
Must attack Shall attack 
The priest nodded
Leave him alone the major said Hes all right
He cant do anything about it anyway the captain
said We all got up and left the table
CHAPTER IV
The battery in the next garden woke me in the
morning and I saw the sun coming through the window
and got out of the bed I went to the window and
looked out The gravel paths were moist and the grass
was wet with dew The battery fired twice and the
air came each time like a blow and shook the window
and made the front of my pajamas flap I could not see
the guns but they were evidently firing directly over us
It was a nuisance to have them there but it was a com
fort that they were no bigger As I looked out at the
garden I heard a motor truck starting on the road I
dressed went downstairs had some coffee in the kitchen
and went out to the garage
Ten cars were lined up side by side under the long
shed They were topheavy bluntnosed ambulances
painted gray and built like movingvans The mechan
ics were working on one out in the yard Three others
were up in the mountains at dressingstations
Do they ever shell that battery I asked one of the
mechanics
No Signor Tenente It is protected by the little
hill
Hows everything
Not so bad This machine is no good but the others
march He stopped working and smiled Were you
on permission
Yes
He wiped his hands on his jumper and grinned
You have a good time The others all grinned too
Fine 1 I said Whats the matter with this ma
chine 
Its no good One thing after another
Whats the matter now
New rings
I left them working the car looking disgraced and
empty with the engine open and parts spread on the
work bench and went in under the shed and looked at
each of the cars They were moderately clean a few
freshly washed the others dusty I looked at the tires
carefully looking for cuts or stone bruises Every
thing seemed in good condition It evidently made no
difference whether I was there to look after things or
not I had imagined that the condition of the cars
whether or not things were obtainable the smooth func
tioning of the business of removing wounded and sick
from the dressing stations hauling them back from the
mountains to the clearing station and then distributing
them to the hospitals named on their papers depended
to a considerable extent on myself Evidently it did
not matter whether I was there or not
Has there been any trouble getting parts I asked
the sergeant mechanic
No Signor Tenente
Where is the gasoKne park now
At the same place
Good I said and went back to the house and
drank another bowl of coffee at the mess table The
coffee was a pale gray and sweet with condensed milk
Outside the window it was a lovely spring morning
There was that beginning of a feeling of dryness in the
nose that meant the day would be hot later on That
day I visited the posts in the mountains and was back
in town late in the afternoon
The whole thing seemed to run better while I was
away The offensive was going to start again I heard
The division for which we worked were to attack at a
place up the river and the major told me that I would see
about the posts for during the attack The attack would
cross the river up above the narrow gorge and spread
up the hillside The posts for the cars would have to
be as near the river as they could get and keep covered
They would of course be selected by the infantry but
we were supposed to work it out It was one of those
things that gave you a false feeling of soldiering
I was very dusty and dirty and went up to my room
to wash Rinaldi was sitting on the bed with a copy
of Hugos English grammar He was dressed wore
his black boots and his hair shone
Splendid he said when he saw me You will
come with me to see Miss Barkley
No
Yes You will please come and make me a good im
pression on her
All right Wait till I get cleaned up
Wash up and come as you are
I washed brushed my hair and we started
Wait a minute Rinaldi said Perhaps we should
have a drink He opened his trunk and took out a
bottle
Not Strega I said
No Grappa
All right
He poured two glasses and we touched them first
fingers extended The grappa was very strong
Another
All right I said We drank the second grappa
Rinaldi put away the bottle and we went down the
stairs It was hot walking through the town but the sun
was starting to go down and it was very pleasant The
British hospital was a big villa built by Germans before
the war Miss Barkley was in the garden Another
nurse was with her We saw their white uniforms
through the trees and walked toward them Rinaldi
saluted I saluted too but more moderately
How do you do Miss Barkley said  You re not
an Italian are you 
Oh no
Rinaldi was talking with the other nurse They were
laughing
What an odd thing  to be in the Italian army
Its not really the army Its only the ambulance
Its very odd though Why did you do it
I dont know I said There isnt always an ex
planation for everything
Oh isnt there I was brought up to think there
was
Thats awfully nice
Do we have to go on and talk this way
No I said
Thats a relief Isnt it
What is the stick I asked Miss Barkley was
quite tall She wore what seemed to me to be a nurses
uniform was blonde and had a tawny skin and gray
eyes I thought she was very beautiful She was carry
ing a thin rattan stick like a toy ridingcrop bound in
leather
It belonged to a boy who was killed last year
Im awfully sorry
He was a very nice boy He was going to marry
me and he was killed in the Somme
It was a ghastly show
Were you there 
No 
Ive heard about it she said Theres not really
any war of that sort down here They sent me the little
stick His mother sent it to me They returned it with
his things
Had you been engaged long
Eight years We grew up together
And why didnt you marry
I dont know she said I was a fool not to I
could have given him that anyway But I thought it
would be bad for him
Have you ever loved any one
No I said
We sat down on a bench and I looked at her
You have beautiful hair I said
Do you like it
Very much
I was going to cut it all off when he died
No
I wanted to do something for him You see I
didnt care about the other thing and he could have had
it all He could have had anything he wanted if I
would have known I would have married him or any
thing I know all about it now But then he wanted to
go to war and I didnt know
I did not say anything
I didnt know about anything then I thought it
would be worse for him I thought perhaps he couldnt
stand it and then of course he was killed and that was
the end of it
I dont know
Oh yes she said Thats the end of it
We looked at Rinaldi talking with the other nurse
What is her name
Ferguson Helen Ferguson Your friend is a doc
tor isnt he
Yes Hes very good
Thats splendid You rarely find any one any good
this close to the front This is close to the front isnt
it
Quite
Its a silly front she said But its very beauti
ful Are they going to have an offensive
Yes
Then well have to work Theres no work now
Have you done nursing long
Since the end of fifteen I started when he did I
remember having a silly idea he might come to the
hospital where I was With a sabre cut I suppose and a
bandage around his head Or shot through the shoul
der Something picturesque
This is the picturesque front I said
Yes she said People cant realize what France is
like If they did it couldnt all go on He didnt have
a sabre cut They blew him all to bits
I didnt say anything
Do you suppose it will always go on
No
Whats to stop it
It will crack somewhere
Well crack Well crack in France They cant go
on doing things like the Somme and not crack
They wont crack here I said
You think not
No They did very well last summer
They may crack she said Anybody may crack
The Germans too
No she said I think not
We went over toward Rinaldi and Miss Ferguson
You love Italy Rinaldi asked Miss Ferguson in
English
Quite well
No understand Rinaldi shook his head
Abbastanza bene I translated He shook his head
That is not good You love England
Not too well Im Scotch you see
Rinaldi looked at me blankly
Shes Scotch so she loves Scotland better than Eng
land I said in Italian
But Scotland is England
I translated this for Miss Ferguson
Pas encore said Miss Ferguson
Not really
Never We do not like the English
Not like the English Not like Miss Barkley
Oh thats different You mustnt take everything
so literally
After a while we said goodnight and left Walking
home Rinaldi said Miss Barkley prefers you to me
That is very clear But the little Scotch one is very
nice
Very I said I had not noticed her You like
her
No said Rinaldi
CHAPTER V
The next afternoon I went to call on Miss Barkley
again She was not in the garden and I went to the
side door of the villa where the ambulances drove up
Inside I saw the head nurse who said Miss Barkley was
on duty  theres a war on you know
I said I knew
Youre the American in the Italian army she
asked
Yes maam
How did you happen to do that Why didnt you
join up with us 
I dont know I said Could I join now
Im afraid not now Tell me Why did you join up
with the Italians
I was in Italy I said and I spoke Italian
Oh she said Im learning it Its a beautiful
language
Somebody said you should be able to learn it in two
weeks
Oh Ill not learn it in two weeks Ive studied it for
months now You may come and see her after seven
oclock if you wish Shell be off then But dont
bring a lot of Italians
Not even for the beautiful language
No Nor for the beautiful uniforms
Good evening I said
A rivederci Tenente
A rivederla I saluted and went out It was im
possible to salute foreigners as an Italian without em
barrassment The Italian salute never seemed made for
export
The day had been hot I had been up the river to the
bridgehead at Plava It was there that the offensive
was to begin It had been impossible to advance on the
far side the year before because there was only one road
leading down from the pass to the pontoon bridge and it
was under machinegun and shell fire for nearly a mile
It was not wide enough either to carry all the trans
port for an offensive and the Austrians could make a
shambles out of it But the Italians had crossed and
spread out a little way on the far side to hold about a
mile and a half on the Austrian side of the river It
was a nasty place and the Austrians should not have let
them hold it I suppose it was mutual tolerance because
the Austrians still kept a bridgehead further down the
river The Austrian trenches were above on the hillside
only a few yards from the Italian lines There had been
a little town but it was all rubble There was what was
left of a railway station and a smashed permanent
bridge that could not be repaired and used because it
was in plain sight
I went along the narrow road down toward the river
left the car at the dressing station under the hill
crossed the pontoon bridge which was protected by
a shoulder of the mountain and went through the
trenches in the smasheddown town and along the edge
of the slope Everybody was in the dugouts There
were racks of rockets standing to be touched oflf to call
for help from the artillery or to signal with if the tele
phone wires were cut It was quiet hot and dirty I
looked across the wire at the Austrian lines Nobody
was in sight I had a drink with a captain that I knew
in one of the dugouts and went back across the bridge
A new wide road was being finished that would go
over the mountain and zigzag down to the bridge
When this road was finished the offensive would start
It came down through the forest in sharp turns The
system was to bring everything down the new road and
take the empty trucks carts and loaded ambulances and
all returning traffic up the old narrow road The dress
ing station was on the Austrian side of the river under
the edge of the hill and stretcherbearers would bring
the wounded back across the pontoon bridge It would
be the same when the offensive started As far as I
could make out the last mile or so of the new road
where it started to level out would be able to be shelled
steadily by the Austrians It looked as though it might
be a mess But I found a place where the cars would
be sheltered after they had passed that last badlooking
bit and could wait for the wounded to be brought across
the pontoon bridge I would have liked to drive over
the new road but it was not yet finished It looked wide
and well made with a good grade and the turns looked
very impressive where you could see them through
openings in the forest on the mountain side The cars
would be all right with their good metaltometal
brakes and anyway coming down they would not be
loaded I drove back up the narrow road
Two carabinieri held the car up A shell had fallen
and while we waited three others fell up the road They
were seventysevens and came with a whishing rush
of air a hard bright burst and flash and then gray smoke
that blew across the road The carabinieri waved us to
go on Passing where the shells had landed I avoided
the small broken places and smelled the high explosive
and the smell of blasted clay and stone and freshly
shattered flint I drove back to Gorizia and our villa
and as I said went to call on Miss Barkley who was on
duty
At dinner I ate very quickly and left for the villa
where the British had their hospital It was really very
large and beautiful and there were fine trees in the
grounds Miss Barkley was sitting on a bench in the
garden Miss Ferguson was with her They seemed
glad to see me and in a little while Miss Ferguson
excused herself and went away
Ill leave you two she said You get along very
well without me
Dont go Helen Miss Barkley said
Td really rather I must write some letters
Goodnight I said
Goodnight Mr Henry
Dont write anything that will bother the censor
Dont worry I only write about what a beautiful
place we live in and how brave the Italians are
That way youll be decorated
That will be nice Goodnight Catherine
Ill see you in a little while Miss Barkley said
Miss Ferguson walked away in the dark
Shes nice I said
Oh yes shes very nice Shes a nurse
Arent you a nurse
Oh no Im something called a V A D We work
very hard but no one trusts us
Why not
They dont trust us when theres nothing going
on When there is really work they trust us
What is the difference
A nurse is like a doctor It takes a long time to
be A V A D is a short cut
I see
The Italians didnt want women so near the front
So were all on very special behavior We dont go
out
I can come here though
Oh yes Were not cloistered
Lets drop the war
Its very hard Theres no place to drop it
Lets drop it anyway
All right
We looked at each other in the dark I thought she
was very beautiful and I took her hand She let me
take it and I held it and put my arm around under her
arm
No she said I kept my arm where it was
Why not
No
Yes I said Please I leaned forward in the
dark to kiss her and there was a sharp stinging flash
She had slapped my face hard Her hand had hit my
nose and eyes and tears came in my eyes from the
reflex
Im so sorry she said I felt I had a certain ad
vantage
You were quite right
Im dreadfully sorry she said I just couldnt
stand the nurse seveningoff aspect of it I didnt mean
to hurt you I did hurt you didnt I 
She was looking at me in the dark I was angry and
yet certain seeing it all ahead like the moves in a chess
game
You did exactly right I said I dont mind at
all
Poor man
You see Ive been leading a sort of a funny life
And I never even talk English And then you are so
very beautiful I looked at her
You dont need to say a lot of nonsense I said I
was sorry We do get along
Yes I said And we have gotten away from the
war
She laughed It was the first time I had ever heard
her laugh I watched her face
You are sweet she said
No Im not
Yes You are a dear Id be glad to kiss you if
you dont mind
I looked in her eyes and put my arm around her as I
had before and kissed her I kissed her hard and held
her tight and tried to open her lips they were closed
tight I was still angry and as I held her suddenly she
shivered I held her close against me and could fed
her heart beating and her lips opened and her head
went back against my hand and then she was crying
on my shoulder
Oh darling she said You will be good to me
wont you
What the hell I thought I stroked her hair and
patted her shoulder She was crying
You will wont you She looked up at me Be
cause were going to have a strange life
After a while I walked with her to the door of the
villa and she went in and I walked home Back at the
villa I went upstairs to the room Rinaldi was lying
on his bed He looked at me
So you make progress with Miss Barkley
We are friends
You have that pleasant air of a dog in heat
I did not understand the word
Of a what
He explained
You I said have that pleasant air of a dog
who
Stop it he said In a little while we would say
insulting things He laughed
Goodnight I said
Goodnight little puppy
I knocked over his candle with the pillow and got
into bed in the dark
Rinaldi picked up the candle lit it and went on
reading
CHAPTER VI
I was away for two days at the posts When I got
home it was too late and I did not see Miss Barkley
until the next evening She was not in the garden and
I had to wait in the office of the hospital until she came
down There were many marble busts on painted
wooden pillars along the walls of the room they used
for an office The hall too that the office opened on
was lined with them They had the complete marble
quality of all looking alike Sculpture had always
seemed a dull business  still bronzes looked like some
thing But marble busts all looked like a cemetery
There was one fine cemetery though  the one at Pisa
Genoa was the place to see the bad marbles This had
been the villa of a very wealthy German and the busts
must have cost him plenty I wondered who had done
them and how much he got I tried to make out
whether they were members of the family or what but
they were all uniformly classical You could not tell
anything about them
I sat on a chair and held my cap We were supposed
to wear steel helmets even in Gorizia but they were un
comfortable and too bloody theatrical in a town where
the civilian inhabitants had not been evacuated I wore
one when we went up to the posts and carried an Eng
lish gas mask We were just beginning to get some of
them They were a real mask Also we were required
to wear an automatic pistol  even doctors and sanitary
officers I felt it against the back of the chair You
were liable to arrest if you did not have one worn in
plain sight Rinaldi carried a holster stuffed with toilet
paper I wore a real one and felt like a gunman until
I practised firing it It was an Astra 765 caliber with
a short barrel and it jumped so sharply when you let it
off that there was no question of hitting anything I
practised with it holding below the target and trying to
master the jerk of the ridiculous short barrel until I
could hit within a yard of where I aimed at twenty
paces and then the ridiculousness of carrying a pistol
at all came over me and I soon forgot it and carried it
flopping against the small of my back with no feeling at
all except a vague sort of shame when I met English
speaking people I sat now in the chair and an orderly
of some sort looked at me disapprovingly from behind
a desk while I looked at the marble floor the pillars
with the marble busts and the frescoes on the wall
and waited for Miss Barkley The frescoes were not
bad Any frescoes were good when they started to peel
and flake off
I saw Catherine Barkley coming down the hall and
stood up She did not seem tall walking toward me but
she looked very lovely
Goodevening Mr Henry she said
How do you do I said The orderly was listening
behind the desk
Shall we sit here or go out in the garden
Lets go out Its much cooler
I walked behind her out into the garden the orderly
looking after us When we were out on the gravel drive
she said Where have you been
Ive been out on post
You couldnt have sent me a note
No I said Not very well I thought I was com
ing back
You ought to have let me know darling f
We were off the driveway walking under the trees
I took her hands then stopped and kissed her
Isnt there anywhere we can go
No she said We have to just walk here Youve
been away a long time
This is the third day But Im back now
She looked at me And you do love me 
Yes
You did say you loved me didnt you
Yes I lied I love you I had not said it
before
And you call me Catherine 
Catherine We walked on a way and were stopped
under a tree
Say Tve come back to Catherine in the night 
Ive come back to Catherine in the night
Oh darling you have come back havent you
Yes
I love you so and its been awful You wont go
away
No Ill always come back
Oh I love you so Please put your hand there
again
Its not been away I turned her so I could see her
face when I kissed her and I saw that her eyes were
shut I kissed both her shut eyes I thought she was
probably a little crazy It was all right if she was I
did not care what I was getting into This was better
than going every evening to the house for officers where
the girls climbed all over you and put your cap on back
ward as a sign of affection between their trips upstairs
with brother officers I knew I did not love Catherine
Barkley nor had any idea of loving her This was a
game like bridge in which you said things instead of
playing cards Like bridge you had to pretend you
were playing for money or playing for some stakes
Nobody had mentioned what the stakes were It was
all right with me
I wish there was some place we could go I said
I was experiencing the masculine difficulty of making
love very long standing up
There isnt any place she said She came back
from wherever she had been
We might sit there just for a little while
We sat on the flat stone bench and I held Catherine
Barkleys hand She would not let me put my arm
around her
Are you very tired she asked
No
She looked down at the grass
This is a rotten game we play isnt it
What game
Dont be dull
Im not on purpose
Youre a nice boy she said And you play it as
well as you know how But its a rotten game
Do you always know what people think
Not always But I do with you You dont have to
pretend you love me Thats over for the evening Is
there anything youd like to talk about
But I do love you
Please lets not lie when we dont have to I had
a very fine little show and Im all right now You see
Im not mad and Im not gone off Its only a little
sometimes
I pressed her hand Dear Catherine
It sounds very funny now  Catherine You dont
pronounce it very much alike But youre very nice
Youre a very good boy
Thats what the priest said
Yes youre very good And you will come and see
me
Of course
And you dont have to say you love me Thats all
over for a while She stood up and put out her hand
Goodnight
I wanted to kiss her
No she said Im awfully tired
Kiss me though I said
Im awfully tired darling
Kiss me
Do you want to very much
Yes
We kissed and she broke away suddenly No
Goodnight please darling We walked to the door
and I saw her go in and down the hall I liked to watch
her move She went on down the hall I went on
home It was a hot night and there was a good deal
going on up in the mountains I watched the flashes
on San Gabriele
I stopped in front of the Villa Rossa The shutters
were up but it was still going on inside Somebody was
singing I went on home Rinaldi came in while I was
undressing
Ah ha he said It does not go so well Baby
is puzzled
Where have you been
At the Villa Rossa It was very edifying baby
We all sang Where have you been
Calling on the British
Thank God I did not become involved with the
British
CHAPTER VII
I came back the next afternoon from our first moun
tain post and stopped the car at the smistimento where
the wounded and sick were sorted by their papers and
the papers marked for the different hospitals I had
been driving and I sat in the car and the driver took the
papers in It was a hot day and the sky was very bright
and blue and the road was white and dusty I sat in the
high seat of the Fiat and thought about nothing A
regiment went by in the road and I watched them pass
The men were hot and sweating Some wore their steel
helmets but most of them carried them slung from their
packs Most of the helmets were too big and came
down almost over the ears of the men who wore them
The officers all wore helmets  betterfitting helmets It
was half of the brigata Basilicata I identified them by
their red and white striped collar mark There were
stragglers going by long after the regiment had passed
  men who could not keep up with their platoons They
were sweaty dusty and tired Some looked pretty bad
A soldier came along after the last of the stragglers
He was walking with a limp He stopped and sat down
beside the road I got down and went over
Whats the matter 
He looked at me then stood up
Im going on
Whats the trouble
 the war
Whats wrong with your leg
Its not my leg I got a rupture
Why dont you ride with the transport  I asked
Why dont you go to the hospital
They wont let me The lieutenant said I slipped the
truss on purpose
Let me feel it
Its way out
Which side is it on
Here
I felt it
Cough I said
Im afraid it will make it bigger Its twice as big
as it was this morning
Sit down I said As soon as I get the papers on
these wounded Ill take you along the road and drop
you with your medical officers
Hell say I did it on purpose
They cant do anything I said Its not a wound
Youve had it before havent you
But I lost the truss
Theyll send you to a hospital
Cant I stay here Tenente
No I havent any papers for you
The driver came out of the door with the papers for
the wounded in the car
Four for 105 Two for 132 he said They were
hospitals beyond the river
You drive I said I helped the soldier with the
rupture up on the seat with us
You speak English he asked
Sure
How you like this goddam war
Rotten
I say its rotten Jesus Christ I say its rotten
Were you in the States
Sure In Pittsburg I knew you was an Ameri
can
Dont I talk Italian good enough
I knew you was an American all right
Another American said the driver in Italian look
ing at the hernia man
Listen lootenant Do you have to take me to that
regiment
Yes
Because the captain doctor knew I had this rupture
I threw away the goddam truss so it would get bad and
I wouldnt have to go to the line again
I see
Couldnt you take me no place else
If it was closer to the front I could take you to a
first medical post But back here youve got to have
papers
If I go back theyll make me get operated on and
then theyll put me in the line all the time
I thought it over
You wouldnt want to go in the line all the time
would you he asked
No
Jesus Christ aint this a goddam war
Listen I said You get out and fall down by the
road and get a bump on your head and Ill pick you up
on our way back and take you to a hospital Well stop
by the road here Aldo We stopped at the side of the
road I helped him down
Ill be right here lieutenant he said
So long I said We went on and passed the regi
ment about a mile ahead then crossed the river cloudy
with snowwater and running fast through the spiles
of the bridge to ride along the road across the plain
and deliver the wounded at the two hospitals I drove
coming back and went fast with the empty car to find
the man from Pittsburg First we passed the regiment
hotter and slower than ever  then the stragglers Then
we saw a horse ambulance stopped by the road Two
men were lifting the hernia man to put him in They
had come back for him He shook his head at me His
helmet was off and his forehead was bleeding below the
hair line His nose was skinned and there was dust on
the bloody patch and dust in his hair
Look at the bump lieutenant  he shouted Noth
ing to do They come back for me
When I got back to the villa it was five oclock and I
went out where we washed the cars to take a shower
Then I made out my report in my room sitting in my
trousers and an undershirt in front of the open win
dow In two days the offensive was to start and I
would go with the cars to Plava It was a long time
since I had written to the States and I knew I should
write but I had let it go so long that it was almost im
possible to write now There was nothing to write
about I sent a couple of army Zona di Guerra post
cards crossing out everything except I am well That
should handle them Those postcards would be very
fine in America strange and mysterious This was a
strange and mysterious war zone but I supposed it was
quite well run and grim compared to other wars with
the Austrians The Austrian army was created to give
Napoleon victories  any Napoleon I wished we had a
Napoleon but instead we had II Generale Cadorna
fat and prosperous and Vittorio Emmanuele the tiny
man with the long thin neck and the goat beard Over
on the right they had the Duke of Aosta Maybe he
was too goodlooking to be a great general but he looked
like a man Lots of them would have liked him to be
king He looked like a king He was the Kings uncle
and commanded the third army We were in the second
army There were some British batteries up with the
third army I had met two gunners from that lot in
Milan They were very nice and we had a big evening
They were big and shy and embarrassed and very ap
preciative together of anything that happened I wish
that I was with the British It would have been much
simpler Still I would probably have been killed Not
in this ambulance business Yes even in the ambulance
business British ambulance drivers were killed some
times Well I knew I would not be killed Not in this
war It did not have anything to do with me It
seemed no more dangerous to me myself than war
in the movies I wished to God it was over though
Maybe it would finish this summer Maybe the Aus
trians would crack They had always cracked in other
wars What was the matter with this war Every
body said the French were through Rinaldi said that
the French had mutinied and troops marched on Paris
I asked him what happened and he said Oh they
stopped them I wanted to go to Austria without war
I wanted to go to the Black Forest I wanted to go to
the Hartz Mountains Where were the Hartz Moun
tains anyway They were fighting in the Carpathians
I did not want to go there anyway It might be good
though I could go to Spain if there was no war The
sun was going down and the day was cooling off After
supper I would go and see Catherine Barkley I wished
she were here now I wished I were in Milan with her
I would like to eat at the Cova and then walk down the
Via Manzoni in the hot evening and cross over and
turn off along the canal and go to the hotel with Cath
erine Barkley Maybe she would Maybe she would
pretend that I was her boy that was killed and we would
go in the front door and the porter would take off his
cap and I would stop at the concierges desk and ask
for the key and she would stand by the elevator and then
we would get in the elevator and it would go up very
slowly clicking at all the floors and then our floor and
the boy would open the door and stand there and she
would step out and I would step out and we would walk
down the hall and I would put the key in the door and
open it and go in and then take down the telephone and
ask them to send a bottle of capri bianca in a silver
bucket full of ice and you would hear the ice against
the pail coming down the corridor and the boy would
knock and I would say leave it outside the door please
Because we would not wear any clothes because it was
so hot and the window open and the swallows flying
over the roofs of the houses and when it was dark
afterward and you went to the window very small bats
hunting over the houses and close down over the trees
and we would drink the capri and the door locked and
it hot and only a sheet and the whole night and we
would both love each other all night in the hot night in
Milan That was how it ought to be I would eat
quickly and go and see Catherine Barkley
They talked too much at the mess and I drank wine
because tonight we were not all brothers unless I drank
a little and talked with the priest about Archbishop
Ireland who was it seemed a noble man and with whose
injustice the injustices he had received and in which I
participated as an American and of which I had never
heard I feigned acquaintance It would have been im
polite not to have known something of them when I had
listened to such a splendid explanation of their causes
which were after all it seemed misunderstandings I
thought he had a fine name and he came from Minne
sota which made a lovely name  Ireland of Minnesota
Ireland of Wisconsin Ireland of Michigan What
made it pretty was that it sounded like Island No that
wasnt it There was more to it than that Yes father
That is true father Perhaps father No father
Well maybe yes father You know more about it than
I do father The priest was good but dull The officers
were not good but dull The King was good but dull
The wine was bad but not dull It took the enamel off
your teeth and left it on the roof of your mouth
And the priest was locked up Rocca said be
cause they found the three per cent bonds on his person
It was in France of course Here they would never
have arrested him He denied all knowledge of the five
per cent bonds This took place at Beziers I was there
and reading of it in the paper went to the jail and asked
to see the priest It was quite evident he had stolen the
bonds
I dont believe a word of this Rinaldi said
Just as you like Rocca said But I am telling it
for our priest here It is very informative He is a
priest he will appreciate it
The priest smiled Go on he said I am listen
ing
Of course some of the bonds were not accounted
for but the priest had all of the three per cent bonds
and several local obligations I forget exactly what they
were So I went to the jail now this is the point of the
story and I stood outside his cell and I said as though
I were going to confession Bless me father for you
have sinned 
There was great laughter from everybody
And what did he say asked the priest Rocca
ignored this and went on to explain the joke to me
You see the point dont you It seemed it was a
very funny joke if you understood it properly They
poured me more wine and I told the story about the
English private soldier who was placed under the show
er bath Then the major told the story of the eleven
Czechoslovaks and the Hungarian corporal After
some more wine I told the story of the jockey who
found the penny The major said there was an Italian
story something like that about the duchess who could
not sleep at night At this point the priest left and I
told the story about the travelling salesman who arrived
at five oclock in the morning at Marseilles when the
mistral was blowing The major said he had heard a
report that I could drink I denied this He said it
was true and by the corpse of Bacchus we would test
whether it was true or not Not Bacchus I said Not
Bacchus Yes Bacchus he said I should drink cup
for cup and glass for glass with Bassi Fillipo Vin
cenza Bassi said no that was no test because he had
already drunk twice as much as I I said that was a
foul lie and Bacchus or no Bacchus Fillipo Vincenza
Bassi or Bassi Fillippo Vicenza had never touched a
drop all evening and what was his name anyway He
said was my name Frederico Enrico or Enrico Feder
ico  I said let the best man win Bacchus barred and
the major started us with red wine in mugs Halfway
through the wine I did not want any more I remem
bered where I was going
Bassi wins I said Hes a better man than I am
I have to go
He does really said Rinaldi He has a rendezvous
I know all about it
I have to go
Another night said Bassi Another night when
you feel stronger He slapped me on the shoulder
There were lighted candles on the table All the officers
were very happy Goodnight gentlemen I said
Rinaldi went out with me We stood outside the
door on the patch and he said Youd better not go up
there drunk
Fm not drunk Rinin Really
Youd better chew some coffee
Nonsense
Ill get some baby You walk up and down He
came back with a handful of roasted coffee beans
Chew those baby and God be with you
Bacchus I said
Ill walk down with you
Im perfectly all right
We walked along together through the town and I
chewed the coffee At the gate of the driveway that
led up to the British villa Rinaldi said goodnight
Goodnight I said Why dont you come in
He shook his head No he said I like the sim
pler pleasures
Thank you for the coffee beans
Nothing baby Nothing
I started down the driveway The outlines of the
cypresses that lined it were sharp and clear I looked
back and saw Rinaldi standing watching me and waved
to him
I sat in the reception hall of the villa waiting for
Catherine Barkley to come down Some one was com
ing down the hallway I stood up but it was not
Catherine It was Miss Ferguson
Hello she said Catherine asked me to tell you
she was sorry she couldnt see you this evening
Im so sorry I hope shes not ill
Shes not awfully well
Will you tell her how sorry I am
Yes I will
Do you think it would be any good to try and see
her tomorrow 
Yes I do
Thank you very much I said Goodnight
I went out the door and suddenly I felt lonely and
empty I had treated seeing Catherine very lightly I
had gotten somewhat drunk and had nearly forgotten
to come but when I could not see her there I was feel
ing lonely and hollow
CHAPTER VIII
The next afternoon we heard there was to be an at
tack up the river that night and that we were to take
four cars there Nobody knew anything about it al
though they all spoke with great positiveness and stra
tegical knowledge I was riding in the first car and as
we passed the entry to the British hospital I told the
driver to stop The other cars pulled up I got out and
told the driver to go on and that if we had not caught
up to them at the junction of the road to Cormons to
wait there I hurried up the driveway and inside the
reception hall I asked for Miss Barkley
Shes on duty
Could I see her just for a moment 
They sent an orderly to see and she came back with
him
I stopped to ask if you were better They told me
you were on duty so I asked to see you
Im quite well she said I think the heat knocked
me over yesterday
I have to go
Ill just step out the door a minute
And youre all right  I asked outside
Yes darling Are you coming tonight
No Im leaving now for a show up above Plava
A show
I dont think its anything
And youll be back
Tomorrow
She was unclasping something from her neck She
put it in my hand Its a Saint Anthony she said
And come tomorrow night
Youre not a Catholic are you
No But they say a Saint Anthonys very useful
Ill take care of him for you Goodby
No she said not goodby
All right
Be a good boy and be careful No you cant kiss
me here You cant
All right
I looked back and saw her standing on the steps
She waved and I kissed my hand and held it out She
waved again and then I was out of the driveway and
climbing up into the seat of the ambulance and we
started The Saint Anthony was in a little white metal
capsule I opened the capsule and spilled him out into
my hand
Saint Anthony asked the driver
Yes
I have one His right hand left the wheel and
opened a button on his tunic and pulled it out from un
der his shirt
See
I put my Saint Anthony back in the capsule spilled
the thin gold chain together and put it all in my breast
pocket
You dont wear him 
No
Its better to wear him Thats what its for
All right I said I undid the clasp of the gold
chain and put it around my neck and clasped it The
saint hung down on the outside of my uniform and I
undid the throat of my tunic unbuttoned the shirt col
lar and dropped him in under the shirt I felt him in
his metal box against my chest while we drove Then I
forgot about him After I was wounded I never found
him Some one probably got it at one of the dressing
stations
We drove fast when we were over the bridge and
soon we saw the dust of the other cars ahead down the
road The road curved and we saw the three cars look
ing quite small the dust rising from the wheels and go
ing off through the trees We caught them and passed
them and turned off on a road that climbed up into the
hills Driving in convoy is not unpleasant if you are
the first car and I settled back in the seat and watched
the country We were in the foothills on the near side
of the river and as the road mounted there were the
high mountains off to the north with snow still on the
tops I looked back and saw the three cars all climb
ing spaced by the interval of their dust We passed a
long column of loaded mules the drivers walking along
beside the mules wearing red fezzes They were ber
saglieri
Beyond the mule train the road was empty and we
climbed through the hills and then went down over the
shoulder of a long hill into a rivervalley There were
trees along both sides of the road and through the right
line of trees I saw the river the water clear fast and
shallow The river was low and there were stretches
of sand and pebbles with a narrow channel of water
and sometimes the water spread like a sheen over the
pebbly bed Close to the bank I saw deep pools the
water blue like the sky I saw arched stone bridges
over the river where tracks turned off from the road
and we passed stone farmhouses with pear trees can
delabraed against their south walls and low stone walls
in the fields The road went up the valley a long way
and then we turned off and commenced to climb into the
hills again The road climbed steeply going up and back
and forth through chestnut woods to level finally along
a ridge I could look down through the woods and see
far below with the sun on it the line of the river that
separated the two armies We went along the rough
new military road that followed the crest of the ridge
and I looked to the north at the two ranges of moun
tains green and dark to the snowline and then white
and lovely in the sun Then as the road mounted along
the ridge I saw a third range of mountains higher
snow mountains that looked chalky white and fur
rowed with strange planes and then there were moun
tains far off beyond all these that you could hardly tell
if you really saw Those were all the Austrians moun
tains and we had nothing like them Ahead there was a
rounded turnoff in the road to the right and looking
down I could see the road dropping through the trees
There were troops on this road and motor trucks and
mules with mountain guns and as we went down keep
ing to the side I could see the river far down below
the line of ties and rails running along it the old bridge
where the railway crossed to the other side and across
under a hill beyond the river the broken houses of the
little town that was to be taken
It was nearly dark when we came down and turned
onto the main road that ran beside the river
CHAPTER IX
The road was crowded and there were screens of
cornstalk and straw matting on both sides and matting
over the top so that it was like the entrance at a circus
or a native village We drove slowly in this matting
covered tunnel and came out onto a bare cleared space
where the railway station had been The road here was
below the level of the river bank and all along the side
of the sunken road there were holes dug in the bank
with infantry in them The sun was going down and
looking up along the bank as we drove I saw the Aus
trian observation balloons above the hills on the other
side dark against the sunset We parked the cars be
yond a brickyard The ovens and some deep holes had
been equipped as dressing stations There were three
doctors that I knew I talked with the major and
learned that when it should start and our cars should be
loaded we would drive them back along the screened
road and up to the main road along the ridge where
there would be a post and other cars to clear them
He hoped the road would not jam It was a oneroad
show The road was screened because it was in sight of
the Austrians across the river Here at the brickyard
we were sheltered from rifle or machinegun fire by the
river bank There was one smashed bridge across the
river They were going to put over another bridge
when the bombardment started and some troops were
to cross at the shallows up above at the bend of the
river The major was a little man with upturned mus
taches He had been in the war in Libya and wore two
woundstripes He said that if the thing went well he
So A FAREWELL TO ARMS
would see that I was decorated I said I hoped it would
go well but that he was too kind I asked him if there
was a big dugout where the drivers could stay and he
sent a soldier to show me I went with him and found
the dugout which was very good The drivers were
pleased with it and I left them there The major asked
me to have a drink with him and two other officers We
drank rum and it was very friendly Outside it was get
ting dark I asked what time the attack was to be and
they said as soon as it was dark I went back to the
drivers They were sitting in the dugout talking and
when I came in they stopped I gave them each a pack
age of cigarettes Macedonias loosely packed ciga
rettes that spilled tobacco and needed to have the ends
twisted before you smoked them Manera lit his lighter
and passed it around The lighter was shaped like a
Fiat radiator I told them what I had heard
Why didnt we see the post when we came down
Passini asked
It was just beyond where we turned off
That road will be a dirty mess Manera said
Theyll shell the out of us
Probably
What about eating lieutenant We wont get a
chance to eat after this thing starts
Fll go and see now I said
You want us to stay here or can we look around 
Better stay here
I went back to the majors dugout and he said the field
kitchen would be along and the drivers could come and
get their stew He would loan them mess tins if they did
not have them I said I thought they had them I went
back and told the drivers I would get them as soon as the
food came Manera said he hoped it would come before
the bombardment started They were silent until I went
out They were all mechanics and hated the war
I went out to look at the cars and see what was going
on and then came back and sat down in the dugout with
the four drivers We sat on the ground with our backs
against the wall and smoked Outside it was nearly dark
The earth of the dugout was warm and dry and I let my
shoulders back against the wall sitting on the small of
my back and relaxed
Who goes to the attack  asked Gavuzzi
Bersaglieri
All bersaglieri
I think so
There arent enough troops here for a real attack
It is probably to draw attention from where the real
attack will be
Do the men know that who attack
I dont think so
Of course they dont Manera said They wouldnt
attack if they did
Yes they would Passini said Bersaglieri are
fools
They are brave and have good discipline I said
They are big through the chest by measurement and
healthy But they are still fools
The granatieri are tall Manera said This was a
joke They all laughed
Were you there Tenente when they wouldnt at
tack and they shot every tenth man
No
It is true They lined them up afterward and took
every tenth man Carabinieri shot them
Carabinieri said Passini and spat on the floor
But those grenadiers  all over six feet They wouldnt
attack
If everybody would not attack the war would be
over Manera said
It wasnt that way with the granatieri They were
afraid The officers all came from such good families
Some of the officers went alone
A sergeant shot two officers who would not get
out
Some troops went out
Those that went out were not lined up when they
took the tenth men
One of those shot by the carabinieri is from my
town Passini said He was a big smart tall boy to be
in the granatieri Always in Rome Always with the
girls Always with the carabinieri He laughed
Now they have a guard outside his house with a bayo
net and nobody can come to see his mother and father
and sisters and his father loses his civil rights and can
not even vote They are all without law to protect them
Anybody can take their property
If it wasnt that that happens to their families no
body would go to the attack
Yes Alpini would These V E soldiers would
Some bersaglieri
Bersaglieri have run too Now they try to forget
it
You should not let us talk this way Tenente Ev
viva 1esercito Passini said sarcastically
I know how you talk I said But as long as you
drive the cars and behave 
  and dont talk so other officers can hear Manera
finished
I believe we should get the war over I said It
would not finish it if one side stopped fighting It
would only be worse if we stopped fighting
It could not be worse Passini said respectfully
There is nothing worse than war
Defeat is worse
I do not believe it Passini said still respectfully
What is defeat You go home
They come after you They take your home They
take your sisters
I dont believe it Passini said They cant do that
to everybody Let everybody defend his home Let
them keep their sisters in the house
They hang you They come and make you be a
soldier again Not in the autoambulance in the in
fantry
They cant hang every one
An outside nation cant make you be a soldier
Manera said At the first battle you all run
Like the Tchecos
I think you do not know anything about being con
quered and so you think it is not bad
Tenente Passini said We understand you let us
talk Listen There is nothing as bad as war We in
the autoambulance cannot even realize at all how bad
it is When people realize how bad it is they cannot do
anything to stop it because they go crazy There are
some people who never realize There are people who
are afraid of their officers It is with them that war is
made
I know it is bad but we must finish it
It doesnt finish There is no finish to a war
Yes there is
Passini shook his head
War is not won by victory What if we take San
Gabriele What if we take the Carso and Monfalcone
and Trieste Where are we then Did you see all the
far mountains today Do you think we could take all
them too Only if the Austrians stop fighting One
side must stop fighting Why dont we stop fighting
If they come down into Italy they will get tired and
go away They have their own country But no in
stead there is a war
Youre an orator
We think We read We are not peasants We are
mechanics But even the peasants know better than to
believe in a war Everybody hates this war
There is a class that controls a country that is stupid
and does not realize anything and never can That is
why we have this war
Also they make money out of it
Most of them dont said Passini They are too
stupid They do it for nothing For stupidity
We must shut up said Manera We talk too
much even for the Tenente
He likes it said Passini We will convert him
But now we will shut up Manera said
Do we eat yet Tenente Gavuzzi asked
I will go and see I said Gordini stood up and
went outside with me
Is there anything I can do Tenente Can I help in
any way He was the quietest one of the four
Come with me if you want I said and well see
It was dark outside and the long light from the
searchlights was moving over the mountains There
were big searchlights on that front mounted on cami
ons that you passed sometimes on the roads at night
close behind the lines the camion stopped a little off the
road an officer directing the light and the crew scared
We crossed the brickyard and stopped at the main
dressing station There was a little shelter of green
branches outside over the entrance and in the dark the
night wind rustled the leaves dried by the sun Inside
there was a light The major was at the telephone sit
ting on a box One of the medical captains said the at
tack had been put forward an hour He offered me a
glass of cognac I looked at the board tables the in
struments shining in the light the basins and the stop
pered bottles Gordini stood behind me The major
got up from the telephone
It starts now he said It has been put back
again
I looked outside it was dark and the Austrian search
lights were moving on the mountains behind us It was
quiet for a moment still then from all the guns behind
us the bombardment started
Savoia said the major
About the soup major I said He did not hear
me I repeated it
It hasnt come up
A big shell came in and burst outside in the brick
yard Another burst and in the noise you could hear
the smaller noise of the brick and dirt raining down
What is there to eat
We have a little pasta asciutta the major said
Ill take what you can give me
The major spoke to an orderly who went out of
sight in the back and came back with a metal basin of
cold cooked macaroni I handed it to Gordini
Have you any cheese
The major spoke grudgingly to the orderly who
ducked back into the hole again and came out with a
quarter of a white cheese
Thank you very much I said
Youd better not go out
Outside something was set down beside the entrance
One of the two men who had carried it looked in
Bring him in said the major Whats the matter
with you Do you want us to come outside and get
him
The two stretcherbearers picked up the man under
the arms and by the legs and brought him in
Slit the tunic the major said
He held a forceps with some gauze in the end The
two captains took off their coats Get out of here the
major said to the two stretcherbearers
Come on I said to Gordini
You better wait until the shelling is over the ma
jor said over his shoulder
They want to eat I said
As you wish
Outside we ran across the brickyard A shell burst
short near the river bank Then there was one that we
did not hear coming until the sudden rush We both
went flat and with the flash and bump of the burst and
the smell heard the singing off of the fragments and
the rattle of falling brick Gordini got up and ran for
the dugout I was after him holding the cheese its
smooth surface covered with brick dust Inside the
dugout were the three drivers sitting against the wall
smoking
Here you patriots I said
How are the cars Manera asked
All right
Did they scare you Tenente
Youre damned right I said
I took out my knife opened it wiped off the blade
and pared off the dirty outside surface of the cheese
Gavuzzi handed me the basin of macaroni
Start in to eat Tenente
No I said Put it on the floor Well all eat
There are no forks
What the hell I said in English
I cut the cheese into pieces and laid them on the
macaroni
Sit down to it I said They sat down and waited
I put thumb and fingers into the macaroni and lifted
A mass loosened
Lift it high Tenente
I lifted it to arms length and the strands cleared I
lowered it into the mouth sucked and snapped in the
ends and chewed then took a bite of cheese chewed
and then a drink of the wine It tasted of rusty metal
I handed the canteen back to Passini
Its rotten he said Its been in there too long
I had it in the car
They were all eating holding their chins close over
the basin tipping their heads back sucking in the ends
I took another mouthful and some cheese and a rinse of
wine Something landed outside that shook the earth
Four hundred twenty or minnenwerfer Gavuzzi
said
There arent any four hundred twenties in the
mountains I said
They have big Skoda guns Ive seen the holes
Three hundred fives
We went on eating There was a cough a noise like
a railway engine starting and then an explosion that
shook the earth again
This isnt a deep dugout Passini said
That was a big trench mortar
Yes sir
I ate the end of my piece of cheese and took a swal
low of wine Through the other noise I heard a cough
then came the chuhchuhchuhchuh  then there was a
flash as when a blastfurnace door is swung open and
a roar that started white and went red and on and on in
a rushing wind I tried to breathe but my breath would
not come and I felt myself rush bodily out of myself
and out and out and out and all the time bodily in the
wind I went out swiftly all of myself and I knew I
was dead and that it had all been a mistake to think you
just died Then I floated and instead of going on I felt
myself slide back I breathed and I was back The
ground was torn up and in front of my head there was
a splintered beam of wood In the jolt of my head I
heard somebody crying I thought somebody was
screaming I tried to move but I could not move I
heard the machineguns and rifles firing across the river
and all along the river There was a great splashing and
I saw the starshells go up and burst and float whitely
and rockets going up and heard the bombs all this in a
moment and then I heard close to me some one saying
Mama Mia Oh mama Mia I pulled and twisted
and got my legs loose finally and turned around and
touched him It was Passini and when I touched him
he screamed His legs were toward me and I saw in
the dark and the light that they were both smashed
above the knee One leg was gone and the other was
held by tendons and part of the trouser and the stump
twitched and jerked as though it were not connected
He bit his arm and moaned Oh mama mia mama
Mia then Dio te salve Maria Dio te salve Maria
Oh Jesus shoot me Christ shoot me mama mia mama
Mia oh purest lovely Mary shoot me Stop it Stop it
Stop it Oh Jesus lovely Mary stop it Oh oh oh oh
then choking Mama mama mia Then he was quiet
biting his arm the stump of his leg twitching
Porta feriti I I shouted holding my hands cupped
Porta Feriti I I tried to get closer to Passini to try
to put a tourniquet on the legs but I could not move I
tried again and my legs moved a little I could pull
backward along with my arms and elbows Passini
was quiet now I sat beside him undid my tunic and
tried to rip the tail of my shirt It would not rip and
I bit the edge of the cloth to start it Then I thought of
his puttees I had on wool stockings but Passini wore
puttees All the drivers wore puttees but Passini had
only one leg I unwound the puttee and while I was
doing it I saw there was no need to try and make a
tourniquet because he was dead already I made sure
he was dead There were three others to locate I sat
up straight and as I did so something inside my head
moved like the weights on a dolls eyes and it hit me
inside in back of my eyeballs My legs felt warm and
wet and my shoes were wet and warm inside I knew
that I was hit and leaned over and put my hand on my
knee My knee wasnt there My hand went in and
my knee was down on my shin I wiped my hand on
my shirt and another floating light came very slowly
down and I looked at my leg and was very afraid Oh
God I said get me out of here I knew however that
there had been three others There were four drivers
Passini was dead That left three Some one took
hold of me under the arms and somebody else lifted my
legs
There are three others I said One is dead
Its Manera We went for a stretcher but there
wasnt any How are you Tenente
Where is Gordini and Gavuzzi
Gordinis at the post getting bandaged Gavuzzi
has your legs Hold on to my neck Tenente Are you
badly hit
In the leg How is Gordini
Hes all right It was a big trench mortar shell
Passings dead
Yes Hes dead
A shell fell close and they both dropped to the ground
and dropped me Im sorry Tenente said Manera
Hang onto my neck
If you drop me again
It was because we were scared
Are you unwounded
We are both wounded a little
Can Gordini drive
I dont think so
They dropped me once more before we reached the
post
You sons of bitches I said
I am sorry Tenente Manera said We wont
drop you again
Outside the post a great many of us lay on the
ground in the dark They carried wounded in and
brought them out I could see the light come out from
the dressing station when the curtain opened and they
brought some one in or out The dead were off to one
side The doctors were working with their sleeves up
to their shoulders and were red as butchers There
were not enough stretchers Some of the wounded
were noisy but most were quiet The wind blew the
leaves in the bower over the door of the dressing sta
tion and the night was getting cold Stretcherbearers
came in all the time put their stretchers down un
loaded them and went away As soon as I got to the
dressing station Manera brought a medical sergeant
out and he put bandages on both my legs He said
there was so much dirt blown into the wound that there
had not been much hemorrhage They would take me
as soon as possible He went back inside Gordini
could not drive Manera said His shoulder was
smashed and his head was hurt He had not felt bad
but now the shoulder had stiffened He was sitting up
beside one of the brick walls Manera and Gavuzzi
each went off with a load of wounded They could drive
all right The British had come with three ambulances
and they had two men on each ambulance One of their
drivers came over to me brought by Gordini who
looked very white and sick The Britisher leaned over
Are you hit badly  he asked He was a tall man
and wore steelrimmed spectacles
In the legs 
Its not serious I hope Will you have a cigarette 
Thanks
They tell me youve lost two drivers 
Yes One killed and the fellow that brought you
What rotten luck Would you like us to take the
cars
Thats what I wanted to ask you
Wed take quite good care of them and return
them to the Villa 206 arent you
Yes
Its a charming place Ive seen you about They
tell me youre an American
Yes
Im English
u Nor
Yes English Did you think I was Italian There
were some Italians with one of our units
It would be fine if you would take the cars I said
Well be most careful of them he straightened up
This chap of yours was very anxious for me to see
you He patted Gordini on the shoulder Gordini
winced and smiled The Englishman broke into voluble
and perfect Italian Now everything is arranged Ive
seen your Tenente We will take over the two cars
You wont worry now He broke off I must do
something about getting you out of here Ill see the
medical wallahs Well take you back with us
He walked across to the dressing station stepping
carefully among the wounded I saw the blanket open
the light came out and he went in
He will look after you Tenente Gordini said
How are you Franco
I am all right He sat down beside me In a
moment the blanket in front of the dressing station
opened and two stretcherbearers came out followed by
the tall Englishman He brought them over to me
Here is the American Tenente he said in Italian
Id rather wait I said There are much worse
wounded than me Im all right
Come come he said Dont be a bloody hero
Then in Italian Lift him very carefully about the
legs His legs are very painful He is the legitimate
son of President Wilson They picked me up and
took me into the dressing room Inside they were oper
ating on all the tables The little major looked at us
furious He recognized me and waved a forceps
Qavabien
Ca va
I have brought him in the tall Englishman said in
Italian The only son of the American Ambassador
He can be here until you are ready to take him Then I
will take him with my first load He bent over me
Ill look up their adjutant to do your papers and it will
all go much faster He stooped to go under the door
way and went out The major was unhooking the for
ceps now dropping them in a basin I followed his
hands with my eyes Now he was bandaging Then
the stretcherbearers took the man off the table
Ill take the American Tenente one of the captains
said They lifted me onto the table It was hard and
slippery There were many strong smells chemical
smells and the sweet smell of blood They took off my
trousers and the medical captain commenced dictating
to the sergeantadjutant while he worked Multiple
superficial wounds of the left and right thigh and left
and right knee and right foot Profound wounds of
right knee and foot Lacerations of the scalp he
probed  Does that hurt  Christ yes with pos
sible fracture of the skull Incurred in the line of duty
Thats what keeps you from being courtmartialled for
selfinflicted wounds he said Would you like a drink
of brandy How did you run into this thing anyway
What were you trying to do  Commit suicide  Anti
tetanus please and mark a cross on both legs Thank
you Ill clean this up a little wash it out and put on a
dressing Your blood coagulates beautifully
The adjutant looking up from the paper What in
flicted the wounds 
The medical captain What hit you 
Me with the eyes shut A trench mortar shell
The captain doing things that hurt sharply and
severing tissue  Are you sure
Me  trying to lie still and feeling my stomach flut
ter when the flesh was cut I think so
Captain doctor  interested in something he was
finding Fragments of enemy trenchmortar shell
Now Ill probe for some of this if you like but its not
necessary Til paint all this and  Does that sting
Good thats nothing to how it will feel later The pain
hasnt started yet Bring him a glass of brandy The
shock dulls the pain  but this is all right you have noth
ing to worry about if it doesnt infect and it rarely
does now How is your head
Good Christ I said
Better not drink too much brandy then If youve
got a fracture you dont want inflammation How does
that feel
Sweat ran all over me
Good Christ I said
I guess youve got a fracture all right Ill wrap
you up and dont bounce your head around He band
aged his hands moving very fast and the bandage
coming taut and sure All right good luck and Vive
la France
Hes an American one of the other captains said
I thought you said he was a Frenchman He talks
French the captain said Ive known him before I
always thought he was French He drank a half
tumbler of cognac Bring on something serious Get
some more of that Antitetanus The captain waved to
me They lifted me and the blanketflap went across
my face as we went out Outside the sergeantadjutant
knelt down beside me where I lay Name he asked
softly Middle name First name Rank Where
born What class What corps and so on Im
sorry for your head Tenente I hope you feel better
Im sending you now with the English ambulance 
Frri all right I said Thank you very much
The pain that the major had spoken about had started
and all that was happening was without interest or rela
tion After a while the English ambulance came up
and they put me onto a stretcher and lifted the stretcher
up to the ambulance level and shoved it in There was
another stretcher by the side with a man on it whose
nose I could see waxylooking out of the bandages
He breathed very heavily There were stretchers lifted
and slid into the slings above The tall English driver
came around and looked in Ill take it very easily he
said I hope youll be comfy I felt the engine start
felt him climb up into the front seat felt the brake
come off and the clutch go in then we started I lay
still and let the pain ride
As the ambulance climbed along the road it was slow
in the traffic sometimes it stopped sometimes it backed
on a turn then finally it climbed quite fast I felt
something dripping At first it dropped slowly and reg
ularly then it pattered into a stream I shouted to the
driver He stopped the car and looked in through the
hole behind his seat
What is it
The man on the stretcher over me has a hemor
rhage
Were not far from the top I wouldnt be able to
get the stretcher out alone He started the car The
stream kept on In the dark I could not see where it
came from the canvas overhead I tried to move side
ways so that it did not fall on me Where it had run
down under my shirt it was warm and sticky I was
cold and my leg hurt so that it made me sick After a
while the stream from the stretcher above lessened and
started to drip again and I heard and felt the canvas
above move as the man on the stretcher settled more
comfortably
How is he the Englishman called back Were
almost up
Hes dead I think I said
The drops fell very slowly as they fall from an icicle
after the sun has gone It was cold in the car in the
night as the road climbed At the post on the top they
took the stretcher out and put another in and we went
on
CHAPTER X
In the ward at the field hospital they told me a visitor
was coming to see me in the afternoon It was a hot
day and there were many flies in the room My orderly
had cut paper into strips and tied the strips to a stick to
make a brush that swished the flies away I watched
them settle on the ceiling When he stopped swishing
and fell asleep they came down and I blew them away
and finally covered my face with my hands and slept
too It was very hot and when I woke my legs itched
I waked the orderly and he poured mineral water on the
dressings That made the bed damp and cool Those of
us that were awake talked across the ward The after
noon was a quiet time In the morning they came to
each bed in turn three men nurses and a doctor and
picked you up out of bed and carried you into the
dressing room so that the beds could be made while
we were having our wounds dressed It was not a
pleasant trip to the dressing room and I did not know
until later that beds could be made with men in them
My orderly had finished pouring water and the bed felt
cool and lovely and I was telling him where to scratch
on the soles of my feet against the itching when one
of the doctors brought in Rinaldi He came in very
fast and bent down over the bed and kissed me I saw
he wore gloves
How are you baby How do you feel I bring
you this   It was a bottle of cognac The orderly
brought a chair and he sat down and good news
You will be decorated They want to get you the
medaglia dargento but perhaps they can get only the
bronze
What for
Because you are gravely wounded They say if you
can prove you did any heroic act you can get the silver
Otherwise it will be the bronze Tell me exactly what
happened Did you do any heroic act
No I said I was blown up while we were eating
cheese
Be serious You must have done something heroic
either before or after Remember carefully
I did not
Didnt you carry anybody on your back Gordini
says you carried several people on your back but the
medical major at the first post declares it is impossible
He has to sign the proposition for the citation
I didnt carry anybody I couldnt move
That doesnt matter said Rinaldi
He took off his gloves
I think we can get you the silver Didnt you re
fuse to be medically aided before the others
Not very firmly
That doesnt matter Look how you are wounded
Look at your valorous conduct in asking to go always
to the first line Besides the operation was successful
Did they cross the river all right
Enormously They take nearly a thousand pris
oners Its in the bulletin Didnt you see it
No
Ill bring it to you It is a successful coup de main
How is everything
Splendid We are all splendid Everybody is proud
of you Tell me just exactly how it happened I am
positive you will get the silver Go on tell me Tell me
all about it He paused and thought Maybe you will
get an English medal too There was an English there
Ill go and see him and ask if he will recommend you
He ought to be able to do something Do you suffer
much Have a drink Orderly go get a corkscrew
Oh you should see what I did in the removal of three
metres of small intestine and better now than ever It
is one for The Lancet You do me a translation and I
will send it to The Lancet Every day I am better
Poor dear baby how do you feel  Where is that damn
corkscrew  You are so brave and quiet I forget you are
suffering He slapped his gloves on the edge of the
bed
Here is the corkscrew Signor Tenente the order
ly said
Open the bottle Bring a glass Drink that baby
How is your poor head  I looked at your papers You
havent any fracture That major at the first post was
a hogbutcher I would take you and never hurt you
I never hurt anybody I learn how to do it Every
day I learn to do things smoother and better You
must forgive me for talking so much baby I am very
moved to see you badly wounded There drink that
Its good It cost fifteen lire It ought to be good
Five stars After I leave here Ill go see that English
and hell get you an English medal
They dont give them like that
You are so modest I will send the liaison officer
He can handle the English
Have you seen Miss Barkley
I will bring her here I will go now and bring her
here
Dont go I said Tell me about Gorizia How
are the girls
There are no girls For two weeks now they havent
changed them I dont go there any more It is dis
graceful They arent girls they are old war com
rades
You dont go at all
I just go to see if there is anything new I stop
by They all ask for you It is a disgrace that they
should stay so long that they become friends
Maybe girls dont want to go to the front any more
Of course they do They have plenty of girls It is
just bad administration They are keeping them for the
pleasure of dugout hiders in the rear
Poor Rinaldi I said All alone at the war with
no new girls
Rinaldi poured himself another glass of the cognac
I dont think it will hurt you baby You take it
I drank the cognac and felt it warm all the way
down Rinaldi poured another glass He was quieter
now He held up the glass To your valorous wounds
To the silver medal Tell me baby when you lie here
all the time in the hot weather dont you get excited 
Sometimes
I cant imagine lying like that I would go crazy
You are crazy
I wish you were back No one to come in at night
from adventures No one to make fun of No one to
lend me money No blood brother and roommate
Why do you get yourself wounded
You can make fun of the priest
That priest It isnt me that makes fun of him It
is the captain I like him If you must have a priest
have that priest Hes coming to see you He makes
big preparations
I like him
Oh I knew it Sometimes I think you and he are
a little that way You know
No you dont
Yes I do sometimes A little that way like the num
ber of the first regiment of the Brigata Ancona
Oh go to hell
He stood up and put on his gloves
Oh I love to tease you baby With your priest and
your English girl and really you are just like me under
neath
No Im not
Yes we are You are really an Italian All fire and
smoke and nothing inside You only pretend to be
American We are brothers and we love each other
Be good while Im gone I said
I will send Miss Barkley You are better with her
without me You are purer and sweeter
Oh go to hell
I will send her Your lovely cool goddess English
goddess My God what would a man do with a woman
like that except worship her  What else is an English
woman good for 
You are an ignorant foulmouthed dago
A what
An ignorant wop
Wop You are a frozenfaced    wop
You are ignorant Stupid I saw that word
pricked him and kept on Uninformed Inexperi
enced stupid from inexperience
Truly I tell you something about your good wo
men Your goddesses There is only one difference be
tween taking a girl who has always been good and a
woman With a girl it is painful Thats all I know
He slapped the bed with his glove And you never
know if the girl will really like it
Dont get angry
Im not angry I just tell you baby for your own
good To save you trouble
Thats the only difference
Yes But millions of fools like you dont know it
You were sweet to tell me
We wont quarrel baby I love you too much But
dont be a fool
No Ill be wise like you
Dont be angry baby Laugh Take a drink I
must go really
Youre a good old boy
Now you see Underneath we are the same We
are war brothers Kiss me goodby
Youre sloppy
No I am just more affectionate
I felt his breath come toward me Goodby I
come to see you again soon His breath went away
I wont kiss you if you dont want Ill send your
English girl Goodby baby The cognac is under the
bed Get well soon
He was gone
CHAPTER XI
It was dusk when the priest came They had brought
the soup and afterward taken away the bowls and I was
lying looking at the rows of beds and out the win
dow at the treetop that moved a little in the evening
breeze The breeze came in through the window and it
was cooler with the evening The flies were on the ceil
ing now and on the electric light bulbs that hung on
wires The lights were only turned on when some one
was brought in at night or when something was being
done It made me feel very young to have the dark
come after the dusk and then remain It was like being
put to bed after early supper The orderly came down
between the beds and stopped Some one was with him
It was the priest He stood there small brownfaced
and embarrassed
How do you do he asked He put some packages
down by the bed on the floor
All right father
He sat down in the chair that had been brought for
Rinaldi and looked out of the window embarrassedly
I noticed his face looked very tired
I can only stay a minute he said It is late
Its not late How is the mess
He smiled I am still a great joke he sounded
tired too Thank God they are all well
I am so glad you are all right he said I hope
you dont suffer He seemed very tired and I was not
used to seeing him tired
Not any more
I miss you at the mess
I wish I were there I always enjoyed our talk
ing
I brought you a few little things he said He
picked up the packages This is mosquito netting
This is a bottle of vermouth You like vermouth
These are English papers
Please open them
He was pleased and undid them I held the mosquito
netting in my hands The vermouth he held up for me
to see and then put it on the floor beside the bed I
held up one of the sheaf of English papers I could
read the headlines by turning it so the halflight from
the window was on it It was The News of the World
The others are illustrated he said
It will be a great happiness to read them Where
did you get them
I sent for them to Mestre I will have more
You were very good to come father Will you
drink a glass of vermouth
Thank you You keep it Its for you
No drink a glass
All right I will bring you more then
The orderly brought the glasses and opened the bot
tle He broke off the cork and the end had to be shoved
down into the bottle I could see the priest was dis
appointed but he said Thats all right Its no mat
ter
Heres to your health father
To your better health
Afterward he held the glass in his hand and we
looked at one another Sometimes we talked and were
good friends but tonight it was difficult
Whats the matter father You seem very tired
I am tired but I have no right to be
Its the heat
No This is only the Spring I feel very low
You have the war disgust
No But I hate the war
I dont enjoy it I said He shook his head and
looked out of the window
You do not mind it You do not see it You must
forgive me I know you are wounded
That is an accident
Still even wounded you do not see it I can tell
I do not see it myself but I feel it a little
When I was wounded we were talking about it
Passini was talking
The priest put down the glass He was thinking
about something else
I know them because I am like they are he said
You are different though
But really I am like they are
The officers dont see anything
Some of them do Some are very delicate and feel
worse than any of us
They are mostly different
It is not education or money It is something else
Even if they had education or money men like Passini
would not wish to be officers I would not be an
officer
You rank as an officer I am an officer
I am not really You are not even an Italian You
are a foreigner But you are nearer the officers than
you are to the men
What is the difference
I cannot say it easily There are people who would
make war In this country there are many like that
There are other people who would not make war
But the first ones make them do it
Yes
And I help them
You are a foreigner You are a patriot
And the ones who would not make war Can they
stop it
I do not know
He looked out of the window again I watched his
face
Have they ever been able to stop it
They are not organized to stop things and when
they get organized their leaders sell them out
Then its hopeless
It is never hopeless But sometimes I cannot hope
I try always to hope but sometimes I cannot
Maybe the war will be over
I hope so
What will you do then
If it is possible I will return to the Abruzzi
His brown face was suddenly very happy
You love the Abruzzi 
Yes I love it very much
You ought to go there then
I would be too happy If I could live there and
love God and serve Him
And be respected I said
Yes and be respected Why not 
No reason not You should be respected
It does not matter But there in my country it is
understood that a man may love God It is not a dirty
joke
I understand
He looked at me and smiled
You understand but you do not love God
No
You do not love Him at all he asked
I am afraid of him in the night sometimes
You should love Him
I dont love much
Yes he said You do What you tell me about
in the nights That is not love That is only passion
and lust When you love you wish to do things for
You wish to sacrifice for You wish to serve
I dont love
You will I know you will Then you will be
happy
Im happy Ive always been happy
It is another thing You cannot know about it un
less you have it
Well I said If I ever get it I will tell you
I stay too long and talk too much He was wor
ried that he really did
No Dont go How about loving women If I
really loved some woman would it be like that
I dont know about that I never loved any woman
What about your mother
Yes I must have loved my mother
Did you always love God
Ever since I was a little boy
Well I said I did not know what to say You
are a fine boy I said
I am a boy he said But you call me father
Thats politeness
He smiled
I must go really he said You do not want me
for anything he asked hopefully
No Just to talk
I will take your greetings to the mess
Thank you for the many fine presents
Nothing
Come and see me again
Yes Goodby he patted my hand
So long I said in dialect
Ciaou he repeated
It was dark in the room and the orderly who had sat
by the foot of the bed got up and went out with him
I liked him very much and I hoped he would get back
to the Abruzzi some time He had a rotten life in the
mess and he was fine about it but I thought how he
would be in his own country At Capracotta he had
told me there were trout in the stream below the town
It was forbidden to play the flute at night When the
young men serenaded only the flute was forbidden
Why I had asked Because it was bad for the girls to
hear the flute at night The peasants all called you
Don and when you met them they took off their hats
His father hunted every day and stopped to eat at the
houses of peasants They were always honored For a
foreigner to hunt he must present a certificate that he
had never been arrested There were bears on the Gran
Sasso Dltalia but it was a long way Aquila was a
fine town It was cool in the summer at night and the
spring in Abruzzi was the most beautiful in Italy But
what was lovely was the fall to go hunting through the
chestnut woods The birds were all good because they
fed on grapes and you never took a lunch because the
peasants were always honored if you would eat with
them at their houses After a while I went to sleep
CHAPTER XII
The room was long with windows on the righthand
side and a door at the far end that went into the dress
ing room The row of beds that mine was in faced the
windows and another row under the windows faced
the wall If you lay on your left side you could see the
dressingroom door There was another door at the far
end that people sometimes came in by If any one were
going to die they put a screen around the bed so you
could not see them die but only the shoes and puttees
of doctors and men nurses showed under the bottom of
the screen and sometimes at the end there would be
whispering Then the priest would come out from be
hind the screen and afterward the men nurses would go
back behind the screen to come out again carrying the
one who was dead with a blanket over him down the
corridor between the beds and some one folded the
screen and took it away
That morning the major in charge of the ward asked
me if I felt that I could travel the next day I said I
could He said then they would ship me out early in
the morning He said I would be better off making the
trip now before it got too hot
When they lifted you up out of bed to carry you into
the dressing room you could look out of the window
and see the new graves in the garden A soldier sat out
side the door that opened onto the garden making
crosses and painting on them the names rank and regi
ment of the men who were buried in the garden He
also ran errands for the ward and in his spare time
made me a cigarette lighter out of an empty Austrian
rifle cartridge The doctors were very nice and seemed
very capable They were anxious to ship me to Milan
where there were better Xray facilities and where af
ter the operation I could take mechanotherapy I
wanted to go to Milan too They wanted to get us all
out and back as far as possible because all the beds were
needed for the offensive when it should start
The night before I left the field hospital Rinaldi came
in to see me with the major from our mess They said
that I would go to an American hospital in Milan that
had just been installed Some American ambulance
units were to be sent down and this hospital would look
after them and any other Americans on service in Italy
There were many in the Red Cross The States had de
clared war on Germany but not on Austria
The Italians were sure America would declare war on
Austria too and they were very excited about any
Americans coming down even the Red Cross They
asked me if I thought President Wilson would declare
war on Austria and I said it was only a matter of days
I did not know what we had against Austria but it
seemed logical that they should declare war on her if
they did on Germany They asked me if we would
declare war on Turkey I said that was doubtful
Turkey I said was our national bird but the joke trans
lated so badly and they were so puzzled and suspicious
that I said yes we would probably declare war on Tur
key And on Bulgaria We had drunk several glasses
of brandy and I said yes by God on Bulgaria too and on
Japan But they said Japan is an ally of England
You cant trust the bloody English The Japanese want
Hawaii I said Where is Hawaii  It is in the Pacific
Ocean Why do the Japanese want it  They dont real
ly want it I said That is all talk The Japanese are a
wonderful little people fond of dancing and light wines
Like the French said the major We will get Nice and
Savoia from the French We will get Corsica and all
the Adriatic coastline Rinaldi said Italy will return
to the splendors of Rome said the major I dont like
Rome I said It is hot and full of fleas You dont
like Rome  Yes I love Rome Rome is the mother of
nations I will never forget Romulus suckling the
Tiber What  Nothing Lets all go to Rome Lets
go to Rome tonight and never come back Rome is a
beautiful city said the major The mother and father
of nations I said Roma is feminine said Rinaldi It
cannot be the father Who is the father then the Holy
Ghost  Dont blaspheme I wasnt blaspheming I was
asking for information You are drunk baby Who
made me drunk I made you drunk said the major
I made you drunk because I love you and because
America is in the war Up to the hilt I said You go
away in the morning baby Rinaldi said To Rome I
said No to Milan To Milan said the major to the
Crystal Palace to the Cova to Camparis to Biffis to
the galleria You lucky boy To the Gran Italia I said
where I will borrow money from George To the Scala
said Rinaldi You will go to the Scala Every night
I said You wont be able to afford it every night said
the major
The tickets are very expensive I will draw a sight
draft on my grandfather I said A what A sight
draft He has to pay or I go to jail Mr Cunningham
at the bank does it I live by sight drafts Can a grand
father jail a patriotic grandson who is dying that Italy
may live  Live the American Garibaldi said Rinaldi
Viva the sight drafts I said We must be quiet said
the major Already we have been asked many times to
be quiet Do you go tomorrow really Federico  He
goes to the American hospital I tell you Rinaldi said
To the beautiful nurses Not the nurses with beards
of the field hospital Yes yes said the major I know
he goes to the American hospital I dont mind their
beards I said If any man wants to raise a beard let
him Why dont you raise a beard Signor Maggiore
It could not go in a gas mask Yes it could Anything
can go in a gas mask Ive vomited into a gas mask
Dont be so loud baby Rinaldi said We all know you
have been at the front Oh you fine baby what will I
do while you are gone We must go said the major
This becomes sentimental Listen I have a surprise for
you Your English You know The English you go
to see every night at their hospital She is going to
Milan too She goes with another to be at the Ameri
can hospital They had not got nurses yet from Amer
ica I talked today with the head of their riparto
They have too many women here at the front They
send some back How do you like that baby All
right Yes  You go to live in a big city and have your
English there to cuddle you Why dont I get wounded 
Maybe you will I said We must go said the major
We drink and make noise and disturb Federico Dont
go Yes we must go Goodby Good luck Many
things Ciaou Ciaou Ciaou Come back quickly
baby Rinaldi kissed me You smell of lysol Good
by baby Goodby Many things The major patted
my shoulder They tiptoed out I found I was quite
drunk but went to sleep
The next day in the morning we left for Milan and
arrived fortyeight hours later It was a bad trip We
were sidetracked for a long time this side of Mestre
and children came and peeked in I got a little boy to
go for a bottle of cognac but he came back and said he
could only get grappa I told him to get it and when it
came I gave him the change and the man beside me and
I got drunk and slept until past Vicenza where I woke
up and was very sick on the floor It did not matter
because the man on that side had been very sick on the
floor several times before Afterward I thought I could
not stand the thirst and in the yards outside of Verona
I called to a soldier who was walking up and down
beside the train and he got me a drink of water I
woke Georgetti the other boy who was drunk and of
fered him some water He said to pour it on his shoul
der and went back to sleep The soldier would not take
the penny I offered him and brought me a pulpy orange
I sucked on that and spit out the pith and watched the
soldier pass up and down past a freightcar outside and
after a while the train gave a jerk and started
BOOK II
CHAPTER XIII
We got into Milan early in the morning and they
unloaded us in the freight yard An ambulance took
me to the American hospital Riding in the ambulance
on a stretcher I could not tell what part of town we
were passing through but when they unloaded the
stretcher I saw a marketplace and an open wine shop
with a girl sweeping out They were watering the
street and it smelled of the early morning They put
the stretcher down and went in The porter came out
with them He had gray mustaches wore a doormans
cap and was in his shirt sleeves The stretcher would
not go into the elevator and they discussed whether it
was better to lift me off the stretcher and go up in the
elevator or carry the stretcher up the stairs I listened
to them discussing it They decided on the elevator
They lifted me from the stretcher Go easy I said
Take it softly
In the elevator we were crowded and as my legs bent
the pain was very bad Straighten out the legs I
said
We cant Signor Tenente There isnt room The
man who said this had his arm around me and my arm
was around his neck His breath came in my face me
tallic with garlic and red wine
Be gentle the other man said
Son of a bitch who isnt gentle 
Be gentle I say the man with my feet repeated
I saw the doors of the elevator closed and the grill
shut and the fourthfloor button pushed by the porter
The porter looked worried The elevator rose slowly
Heavy I asked the man with the garlic
Nothing he said His face was sweating and he
grunted The elevator rose steadily and stopped The
man holding the feet opened the door and stepped out
We were on a balcony There were several doors with
brass knobs The man carrying the feet pushed a but
ton that rang a bell We heard it inside the doors No
one came Then the porter came up the stairs
Where are they the stretcherbearers asked
I dont know said the porter They sleep down
stairs
Get somebody
The porter rang the bell then knocked on the door
then he opened the door and went in When he came
back there was an elderly woman wearing glasses with
him Her hair was loose and half falling and she wore
a nurses dress
I cant understand she said I cant understand
Italian
I can speak English I said They want to put me
somewhere
None of the rooms are ready There isnt any pa
tient expected She tucked at her hair and looked at
me nearsightedly
Show them any room where they can put me
I dont know she said Theres no patient ex
pected I couldnt put you in just any room
Any room will do I said Then to the porter in
Italian Find an empty room
They are all empty said the porter You are the
first patient He held his cap in his hand and looked
at the elderly nurse
For Christs sweet sake take me to some room
The pain had gone on and 99 with the legs bent and I
could feel it going in and out of the bone The porter
went in the door followed by the grayhaired woman
then came hurrying back Follow me he said They
carried me down a long hallway and into a room with
drawn blinds It smelled of new furniture There was
a bed and a big wardrobe with a mirror They laid me
down on the bed
I cant put on sheets the woman said The sheets
are locked up
I did not speak to her There is money in my
pocket I said to the porter In the buttoneddown
pocket The porter took out the money The two
stretcherbearers stood beside the bed holding their
caps Give them five lire apiece and five lire for your
self My papers are in the other pocket You may give
them to the nurse
The stretcherbearers saluted and said thank you
Goodby I said And many thanks They saluted
again and went out
Those papers I said to the nurse describe my
case and the treatment already given
The woman picked them up and looked at them
through her glasses There were three papers and they
were folded I dont know what to do she said I
cant read Italian I cant do anything without the
doctors orders She commenced to cry and put the
papers in her apron pocket Are you an American
she asked crying
Yes Please put the papers on the table by the bed
It was dim and cool in the room As I lay on the
bed I could see the big mirror on the other side of the
room but could not see what it reflected The porter
stood by the bed He had a nice face and was very
kind
You can go I said to him You can go too I
said to the nurse What is your name
Mrs Walker
You can go Mrs Walker I think I will go to
sleep
I was alone in the room It was cool and did not
smell like a hospital The mattress was firm and com
fortable and I lay without moving hardly breathing
happy in feeling the pain lessen After a while I wanted
a drink of water and found the bell on a cord by the
bed and rang it but nobody came I went to sleep
When I woke I looked around There was sunlight
coming in through the shutters I saw the big armoire
the bare walls and two chairs My legs in the dirty
bandages stuck straight out in the bed I was careful
not to move them I was thirsty and I reached for the
bell and pushed the button I heard the door open and
looked and it was a nurse She looked young and
pretty
Goodmorning I said
Goodmorning she said and came over to the bed
We havent been able to get the doctor Hes gone to
Lake Como No one knew there was a patient coming
Whats wrong with you anyway
Im wounded In the legs and feet and my head
is hurt
Whats your name
Henry Frederic Henry
Ill wash you up But we cant do anything to the
dressings until the doctor comes
Is Miss Barkley here
No Theres no one by that name here
Who was the woman who cried when I came in
The nurse laughed Thats Mrs Walker She was
on night duty and shed been asleep She wasnt ex
pecting any one
While we were talking she was undressing me and
when I was undressed except for the bandages she
washed me very gently and smoothly The washing
felt very good There was a bandage on my head but
she washed all around the edge
Where were you wounded
On the Isonzo north of Plava
Where is that
North of Gorizia
I could see that none of the places meant anything
to her
Do you have a lot of pain
No Not much now
She put a thermometer in my mouth
The Italians put it under the arm I said
Dont talk
When she took the thermometer out she read it and
then shook it
Whats the temperature
Youre not supposed to know that
Tell me what it is
Its almost normal
I never have any fever My legs are full of old iron
too
What do you mean
Theyre full of trenchmortar fragments old screws
and bedsprings and things
She shook her head and smiled
If you had any foreign bodies in your legs they
would set up an inflammation and youd have fever
All right I said Well see what omes out
She went out of the room and came back with the
old nurse of the early morning Together they made
the bed with me in it That was new to me and an
admirable proceeding
Who is in charge here
Miss Van Campen
How many nurses are there
Just us two
Wont there be more
Some more are coming
When will they get here
I dont know You ask a great many questions for
a sick boy
Im not sick I said Im wounded
They had finished making the bed and I lay with a
clean smooth sheet under me and another sheet over
me Mrs Walker went out and came back with a
pajama jacket They put that on me and I felt very
clean and dressed
Youre awfully nice to me I said The nurse
called Miss Gage giggled Could I have a drink of
water I asked
Certainly Then you can have breakfast
I dont want breakfast Can I have the shutters
opened please
The light had been dim in the room and when the
shutters were opened it was bright sunlight and I
looked out on a balcony and beyond were the tile roofs
of houses and chimneys I looked out over the tiled
roofs and saw white clouds and the sky very blue
Dont you know when the other nurses are com
ing
Why Dont we take good care of you
Youre very nice
Would you like to use the bedpan
I might try
They helped me and held me up but it was not any
use Afterward I lay and looked out the open doors
onto the balcony
When does the doctor come
When he gets back Weve tried to telephone to
Lake Como for him
Arent there any other doctors
Hes the doctor for the hospital
Miss Gage brought a pitcher of water and a glass I
drank three glasses and then they left me and I looked
out the window a while and went back to sleep I ate
some lunch and in the afternoon Miss Van Campen
the superintendent came up to see me She did not
like me and I did not like her She was small and
neatly suspicious and too good for her position She
asked many questions and seemed to think it was some
what disgraceful that I was with the Italians
Can I have wine with the meals I asked her
Only if the doctor prescribes it
I cant have it until he comes
Absolutely not
You plan on having him come eventually
Weve telephoned him at Lake Como
She went out and Miss Gage came back
Why were you rude to Miss Van Campen she
asked after she had done something for me very skil
fully
I didnt mean to be But she was snooty
She said you were domineering and rude
I wasnt But whats the idea of a hospital with
out a doctor
Hes coming Theyve telephoned for him to Lake
Como
What does he do there Swim
No He has a clinic there
Why dont they get another doctor
Hush Hush Be a good boy and hell come
I sent for the porter and when he came I told him in
Italian to get me a bottle of Cinzano at the wine shop
a fiasco of chianti and the evening papers He went
away and brought them wrapped in newspaper un
wrapped them and when I asked him to drew the corks
and put the wine and vermouth under the bed They
left me alone and I lay in bed and read the papers
awhile the news from the front and the list of dead
officers with their decorations and then reached down
and brought up the bottle of Cinzano and held it
straight up on my stomach the cool glass against my
stomach and took little drinks making rings on my
stomach from holding the bottle there between drinks
and watched it get dark outside over the roofs of the
town The swallows circled around and I watched them
and the nighthawks flying above the roofs and drank
the Cinzano Miss Gage brought up a glass with some
eggnog in it I lowered the vermouth bottle to the
other side of the bed when she came in
Miss Van Campen had some sherry put in this
she said You shouldnt be rude to her Shes not
young and this hospital is a big responsibility for her
Mrs Walkers too old and shes no use to her
Shes a splendid woman I said Thank her very
much
Im going to bring your supper right away
Thats all right I said Im not hungry
When she brought the tray and put it on the bed
table I thanked her and ate a little of the supper After
ward it was dark outside and I could see the beams of
the searchlights moving in the sky I watched for a
while and then went to sleep I slept heavily except
once I woke sweating and scared and then went back
to sleep trying to stay outside of my dream I woke
for good long before it was light and heard roosters
crowing and stayed on awake until it began to be light
I was tired and once it was really light I went back to
sleep again
