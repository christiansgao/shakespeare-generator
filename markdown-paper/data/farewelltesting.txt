CHAPTER XIV

It was bright sunlight in the room when I woke I
thought I was back at the front and stretched out in
bed My legs hurt me and I looked down at them still
in the dirty bandages and seeing them knew where I
was I reached up for the bellcord and pushed the
button I heard it buzz down the hall and then some
one coming on rubber soles along the hall It was Miss
Gage and she looked a little older in the bright sun
light and not so pretty

Good morning she said Did you have a good
night 

Yes Thanks very much I said Can I have a
barber

I came in to see you and you were asleep with this
in the bed with you

She opened the armoire door and held up the ver
mouth bottle It was nearly empty I put the other
bottle from under the bed in there too she said
Why didnt you ask me for a glass

I thought maybe you wouldnt let me have it

Id have had some with you

Youre a fine girl

It isnt good for you to drink alone she said
You mustnt do it

All right

Your friend Miss Barkleys come she said

Really

Yes I dont like her

You will like her Shes awfully nice




She shook her head Im sure shes fine Can you
move just a little to this side Thats fine Ill clean
you up for breakfast She washed me with a cloth
and soap and warm water Hold your shoulder up
she said Thats fine

Can I have the barber before breakfast

Ill send the porter for him She went out and
came back Hes gone for him she said and dipped
the cloth she held in the basin of water

The barber came with the porter He was a man of
about fifty with an upturned mustache Miss Gage
was finished with me and went out and the barber
lathered my face and shaved He was very solemn and
refrained from talking

Whats the matter  Dont you know any news  I
asked

What news

Any news Whats happened in the town

It is time of war he said The enemys ears are
everywhere

I looked up at him Please hold your face still he
said and went on shaving I will tell nothing

Whats the matter with you I asked

I am an Italian I will not communicate with the
enemy

I let it go at that If he was crazy the sooner I could
get out from under the razor the better Once I tried
to get a good look at him Beware he said The
razor is sharp

I paid him when it was over and tipped him half a
lira He returned the coins

I will not I am not at the front But I am an
Italian

Get the hell out of here




With your permission he said and wrapped his
razors in newspaper He went out leaving the five
copper coins on the table beside the bed I rang the
bell Miss Gage came in Would you ask the porter
to come please

All right

The porter came in He was trying to keep from
laughing

Is that barber crazy

No signorino He made a mistake He doesnt
understand very well and he thought I said you were
an Austrian officer

Oh I said

Ho ho ho the porter laughed He was funny
One move from you he said and he would have   he
drew his forefinger across his throat

Ho ho ho he tried to keep from laughing
When I tell him you were not an Austrian Ho ho
ho

Ho ho ho I said bitterly How funny if he
would cut my throat Ho ho ho

No signorino No no He was so frightened of
an Austrian Ho ho ho

Ho ho ho I said Get out of here

He went out and I heard him laughing in the hall
I heard some one coming down the hallway I looked
toward the door It was Catherine Barkley

She came in the room and over to the bed

Hello darling she said She looked fresh and
young and very beautiful I thought I had never seen
any one so beautiful

Hello I said When I saw her I was in love with
her Everything turned over inside of me She
looked toward the door saw there was no one then she




sat on the side of the bed and leaned over and kissed
me I pulled her down and kissed her and felt her
heart beating

You sweet I said Werent you wonderful to
come here

It wasnt very hard It may be hard to stay
Youve got to stay I said Oh youre wonder
ful I was crazy about her I could not believe she
was really there and held her tight to me

Catherine sat in a chair by the bed The door was

open into the hall The wildness was gone and I felt

finer than I had ever felt

She asked Now do you believe I love you 
Oh youre lovely I said Youve got to stay

Goodby

Goodby sweet

She went out God knows I had not wanted to fall
in love with her I had not wanted to fall in love with
any one But God knows I had and I lay on the bed
in the room of the hospital in Milan and all sorts of
things went through my head but I felt wonderful and
finally Miss Gage came in

The doctors coming she said He telephoned
from Lake Como

When does he get here

Hell be here this afternoon






CHAPTER XV

Nothing happened until afternoon The doctor
was a thin quiet little man who seemed disturbed by
the war He took out a number of small steel splinters
from my thighs with delicate and refined distaste He
used a local anaesthetic called something or other snow
which froze the tissue and avoided pain until the probe
the scalpel or the forceps got below the frozen portion
The anaesthetized area was clearly defined by the pa
tient and after a time the doctors fragile delicacy was
exhausted and he said it would be better to have an
Xray Probing was unsatisfactory he said

The Xray was taken at the Ospedale Maggiore and
the doctor who did it was excitable efficient and cheer
ful It was arranged by holding up the shoulders that
the patient should see personally some of the larger
foreign bodies through the machine The plates were
to be sent over The doctor requested me to write in
his pocket notebook my name and regiment and some
sentiment He declared that the foreign bodies were
ugly nasty brutal The Austrians were sons of bitches
How many had I killed I had not killed any but I
was anxious to please  and I said I had killed plenty
Miss Gage was with me and the doctor put his arm
around her and said she was more beautiful than Cleo
patra Did she understand that Cleopatra the for
mer queen of Egypt Yes by God she was We re
turned to the little hospital in the ambulance and after
a while and much lifting I was upstairs and in bed
again The plates came that afternoon the doctor had
said by God he would have them that afternoon and he




did Catherine Barkley showed them to me They
were in red envelopes and she took them out of the en
velopes and held them up to the light and we both
looked

Thats your right leg she said then put the plate
back in the envelope This is your left

Put them away I said and come over to the
bed

I cant she said I just brought them in for a
second to show you

She went out and I lay there It was a hot after
noon and I was sick of lying in bed I sent the porter
for the papers all the papers he could get

Before he came back three doctors came into the room
I have noticed that doctors who fail in the practice of
medicine have a tendency to seek one anothers com
pany and aid in consultation A doctor who cannot
take out your appendix properly will recommend to
you a doctor who will be unable to remove your tonsils
with success These were three such doctors

This is the young man said the house doctor with
the delicate hands

How do you do said the tall gaunt doctor with
the beard The third doctor who carried the Xray
plates in their red envelopes said nothing

Remove the dressings questioned the bearded
doctor

Certainly Remove the dressings please nurse
the house doctor said to Miss Gage Miss Gage re
moved the dressings I looked down at the legs At
the field hospital they had the look of not too freshly
ground hamburger steak Now they were crusted and
the knee was swollen and discolored and the calf
sunken but there was no pus




Very clean said the house doctor Very clean
and nice

Urn said the doctor with the beard The third
doctor looked over the house doctors shoulder

Please move the knee said the bearded doctor

I cant

Test the articulation the bearded doctor ques
tioned He had a stripe beside the three stars on his
sleeve That meant he was a first captain

Certainly the house doctor said Two of them
took hold of my right leg very gingerly and bent it

That hurts I said

Yes Yes A little further doctor

Thats enough Thats as far as it goes I said

Partial articulation said the first captain He
straightened up May I see the plates again please
doctor The third doctor handed him one of the
plates No The left leg please

That is the left leg doctor

You are right I was looking from a different an
gle He returned the plate The other plate he exam
ined for some time You see doctor he pointed to
one of the foreign bodies which showed spherical and
clear against the light They examined the plate for
some time

Only one thing I can say the first captain with the
beard said It is a question of time Three months
six months probably

Certainly the synovial fluid must reform

Certainly It is a question of time I could not
conscientiously open a knee like that before the projec
tile was encysted

I agree with you doctor

Six months for what I asked



io 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS

Six months for the projectile to encyst before the
knee can be opened safely

I dont believe it I said

Do you want to keep your knee young man

No I said

What

I want it cut off I said so I can wear a hook on
it

What do you mean A hook

He is joking said the house doctor He patted
my shoulder very delicately He wants to keep his
knee This is a very brave young man He has been
proposed for the silver medal of valor

All my felicitations said the first captain He
shook my hand I can only say that to be on the safe
side you should wait at least six months before open
ing such a knee You are welcome of course to an
other opinion

Thank you very much I said I value your
opinion

The first captain looked at his watch

We must go he said All my best wishes

All my best wishes and many thanks I said I
shook hands with the third doctor Capitano Varini 
Tenente Enry and they all three went out of the room

Miss Gage I called She came in Please ask
the house doctor to come back a minute

He came in holding his cap and stood by the bed
Did you wish to see me

Yes I cant wait six months to be operated on
My God doctor did you ever stay in bed six months

You wont be in bed all the time You must first
have the wounds exposed to the sun Then afterward
you can be on crutches




For six months and then have an operation

That is the safe way The foreign bodies must be
allowed to encyst and the synovial fluid will reform
Then it will be safe to open up the knee

Do you really think yourself I will have to wait
that long

That is the safe way

Who is that first captain

He is a very excellent surgeon of Milan

Hes a first captain isnt he

Yes but he is an excellent surgeon

I dont want my leg fooled with by a first captain
If he was any good he would be made a major I
know what a first captain is doctor

He is an excellent surgeon and I would rather have
his judgment than any surgeon I know

Could another surgeon see it

Certainly if you wish But I would take Dr Va
rellas opinion myself

Could you ask another surgeon to come and see
it

I will ask Valentini to come

Who is he

He is a surgeon of the Ospedale Maggiore

Good I appreciate it very much You understand
doctor I couldnt stay in bed six months

You would not be in bed You would first take a
sun cure Then you could have light exercise Then
when it was encysted we would operate

But I cant wait six months

The doctor spread his delicate fingers on the cap he
held and smiled You are in such a hurry to get back
to the front

Why not




It is very beautiful he said You are a noble
young man He stooped over and kissed me very del
icately on the forehead I will send for Valentini
Do not worry and excite yourself Be a good boy

Will you have a drink I asked

No thank you I never drink alcohol

Just have one I rang for the porter to bring
glasses

No No thank you They are waiting for me

Goodby I said

Goodby

Two hours later Dr Valentini came into the room
He was in a great hurry and the points of his mustache
stood straight up He was a major his face was
tanned and he laughed all the time

How did you do it this rotten thing he asked
Let me see the plates Yes Yes Thats it You look
healthy as a goat Whos the pretty girl Is she your
girl I thought so Isnt this a bloody war How
does that feel  You are a fine boy Ill make you bet
ter than new Does that hurt You bet it hurts
How they love to hurt you these doctors What have
they done for you so far  Cant that girl talk Italian 
She should learn What a lovely girl I could teach
her I will be a patient here myself No but I will do
all your maternity work free Does she understand
that  She will make you a fine boy A fine blonde like
she is Thats fine Thats all right What a lovely
girl Ask her if she eats supper with me No I wont
take her away from you Thank you Thank you very
much Miss Thats all

Thats all I want to know He patted me on the
shoulder Leave the dressings off




 Will you have a drink Dr Valentini 
A drink Certainly I will have ten drinks
Where are they

In the armoire Miss Barkley will get the bottle
Cheery oh Cheery oh to you Miss What a
lovely girl I will bring you better cognac than that
He wiped his mustache

When do you think it can be operated on
Tomorrow morning Not before Your stomach
must be emptied You must be washed out I will see
the old lady downstairs and leave instructions Good
by I see you tomorrow Ill bring you better cognac
than that You are very comfortable here Goodby
Until tomorrow Get a good sleep Ill see you
early He waved from the doorway his mustaches
went straight up his brown face was smiling There
was a star in a box on his sleeve because he was a
major



CHAPTER XVI

That night a bat flew into the room through the
open door that led onto the balcony and through which
we watched the night over the roofs of the town It
was dark in our room except for the small light of the
night over the town and the bat was not frightened but
hunted in the room as though he had been outside We
lay and watched him and I do not think he saw us be
cause we lay so still After he went out we saw a
searchlight come on and watched the beam move across
the sky and then go off and it was dark again A
breeze came in the night and we heard the men of the
antiaircraft gun on the next roof talking It was cool
and they were putting on their capes I worried in
the night about some one coming up but Catherine said
they were all asleep Once in the night we went to
sleep and when I woke she was not there but I heard
her coming along the hall and the door opened and she
came back to the bed and said it was all right she had
been downstairs and they were all asleep She had
been outside Miss Van Campens door and heard her
breathing in her sleep She brought crackers and we
ate them and drank some vermouth We were very
hungry but she said that would all have to be gotten
out of me in the morning I went to sleep again in the
morning when it was light and when I was awake I
found she was gone again She came in looking fresh
and lovely and sat on the bed and the sun rose while I
had the thermometer in my mouth and we smelled the
dew on the roofs and then the coffee of the men at the
gun on the next roof





I wish we could go for a walk Catherine said
Id wheel you if we had a chair

How would I get into the chair

Wed do it

We could go out to the park and have breakfast
outdoors I looked out the open doorway

What well really do she said is get you ready
for your friend Dr Valentini

I thought he was grand

I didnt like him as much as you did But I imag
ine hes very good

Come back to bed Catherine Please I said

I cant Didnt we have a lovely night

splendid impression

Oh I love you darling

Outside the sun was up over the roofs and I could
see the points of the cathedral with the sunlight on
them I was clean inside and outside and waiting for
the doctor

And thats it Catherine said She says just
what he wants her to

Not always

But I will Ill say just what you wish and Ill do

more Just what you want

other girls do you

No

You see Im good I do what you want



CHAPTER XVII

When I was awake after the operation I had not
been away You do not go away They only choke
you It is not like dying it is just a chemical choking
so you do not feel and afterward you might as well
have been drunk except that when you throw up noth
ing comes but bile and you do not feel better after
ward I saw sandbags at the end of the bed They
were on pipes that came out of the cast After a while
I saw Miss Gage and she said How is it now

Better I said

He did a wonderful job on your knee

How long did it take 

Two hours and a half

Did I say anything silly

Not a thing Dont talk Just be quiet

I was sick and Catherine was right It did not make
any difference who was on night duty

There were three other patients in the hospital now
a thin boy in the Red Cross from Georgia with mala
ria a nice boy also thin from New York with mala
ria and jaundice and a fine boy who had tried to un
screw the fusecap from a combination shrapnel and
high explosive shell for a souvenir This was a shrap
nel shell used by the Austrians in the mountains with a
nosecap which went on after the burst and exploded
on contact

Catherine Barkley was greatly liked by the nurses
because she would do night duty indefinitely She had
quite a little work with the malaria people the boy who





had unscrewed the nosecap was a friend of ours and
never rang at night unless it was necessary but be
tween the times of working we were together I loved
her very much and she loved me I slept in the day
time and we wrote notes during the day when we were
awake and sent them by Ferguson Ferguson was a
fine girl I never learned anything about her except
that she had a brother in the FiftySecond Division
and a brother in Mesopotamia and she was very good
to Catherine Barkley

Will you come to our wedding Fergy I said to
her once

Youll never get married

We will

No you wont

Why not

Youll fight before youll marry

We never fight

Youve time yet

We dont fight

Youll die then Fight or die Thats what people
do They dont marry

I reached for her hand Dont take hold of me
she said Im not crying Maybe youll be all right
you two But watch out you dont get her in trouble
You get her in trouble and Ill kill you

I wont get her in trouble

Well watch out then I hoge youll be all right
You have a good time

We have a fine time

Dont fight then and dont get her into trouble

Mind you watch out I dont want her with any of
these war babies



n6 A FAREWELL TO ARMS

Youre a fine girl Fergy

Im not Dont try to flatter me How does your
leg feel

Fine

How is your head She touched the top of it
with her fingers It was sensitive like a foot that had
gone to sleep Its never bothered me

A bump like that could make you crazy It never
bothers you

No

Youre a lucky young man Have you the letter
done Im going down

Its here I said

You ought to ask her not to do night duty for a
while Shes getting very tired

All right I will

I want to do it but she wont let me The others
are glad to let her have it You might give her just a
little rest

All right

Miss Van Campen spoke about you sleeping all the
forenoons

She would

It would be better if you let her stay off nights a
little while

I want her to

You do not But if you would make her Id re
spect you for it

Ill make her

I dont believe it She took the note and went out
I rang the bell and in a little while Miss Gage came in

Whats the matter

I just wanted to talk to you Dont you think Miss
Barkley ought to go off night duty for a while She




looks awfully tired Why does she stay on so long

Miss Gage looked at me

Im a friend of yours she said You dont have
to talk to me like that

What do you mean

Dont be silly Was that all you wanted

Do you want a vermouth

All right Then I have to go She got out the
bottle from the armoire and brought a glass

You take the glass I said Til drink out of the
bottle

Heres to you said Miss Gage

What did Van Campen say about me sleeping late
in the mornings

She just jawed about it She calls you our priv
ileged patient

To hell with her

She isnt mean Miss Gage said Shes just old
and cranky She never liked you

No

Well I do And Im your friend Dont forget
that

Youre awfully damned nice

No I know who you think is nice But Im your
friend How does your leg feel

Fine

Ill bring some cold mineral water to pour over it
It must itch under the cast Its hot outside

Youre awful nice

Does it itch much

No Its fine

Ill fix those sandbags better She leaned over
Im your friend

I know you are



n8 A FAREWELL TO ARMS

No you dont But you will some day
Catherine Barkley took three nights off night duty
and then she came back on again It was as though we
met again after each of us had been away on a long
journey



CHAPTER XVIII

We had a lovely time that summer When I could
go out we rode in a carriage in the park I remember
the carriage the horse going slowly and up ahead the
back of the driver with his varnished high hat and
Catherine Barkley sitting beside me If we let our
hands touch just the side of my hand touching hers
we were excited Afterward when I could get around
on crutches we went to dinner at Biffis or the Gran
Italia and sat at the tables outside on the floor of the
galleria The waiters came in and out and there were
people going by and candles with shades on the table
cloths and after we decided that we liked the Gran
Italia best George the headwaiter saved us a table
He was a fine waiter and we let him order the meal
while we looked at the people and the great galleria in
the dusk and each other We drank dry white capri
iced in a bucket  although we tried many of the other
wines f resa barbera and the sweet white wines They
had no wine waiter because of the war and George
would smile ashamedly when I asked about wines like
fresa

If you imagine a country that makes a wine be
cause it tastes like strawberries he said

Why shouldnt it Catherine asked It sounds
splendid 

You try it lady said George if you want to
But let me bring a little bottle of margaux for the
Tenente

Ill try it too George




Sir I cant recommend you to It doesnt even
taste like strawberries

It might said Catherine It would be wonderful
if it did

Ill bring it said George and when the Lady is
satisfied Ill take it away

It was not much of a wine As he said it did not
even taste like strawberries We went back to capri
One evening I was short of money and George loaned
me a hundred lire Thats all right Tenente he said
I know how it is I know how a man gets short If
you or the lady need money Ive always got money

After dinner we walked through the galleria past
the other restaurants and the shops with their steel
shutters down and stopped at the little place where
they sold sandwiches  ham and lettuce sandwiches and
anchovy sandwiches made of very tiny brown glazed
rolls and only about as long as your finger They were
to eat in the night when we were hungry Then we got
into an open carriage outside the galleria in front of
the cathedral and rode to the hospital At the door of
the hospital the porter came out to help w r ith the
crutches I paid the driver and then we rode upstairs
in the elevator Catherine got off at the lower floor
where the nurses lived and I went on up and went
down the hall on crutches to my room  sometimes I un
dressed and got into bed and sometimes I sat out on the
balcony with my leg up on another chair and watched
the swallows over the roofs and waited for Catherine
When she came upstairs it was as though she had been
away on a long trip and I went along the hall with her
on the crutches and carried the basins and waited out
side the doors or went in with her it depending on
whether they were friends of ours or not and when




she had done all there was to be done we sat out on the
balcony outside my room Afterward I went to bed
and when they were all asleep and she was sure they
would not call she came in I loved to take her hair
down and she sat on the bed and kept very still except
suddenly she would dip down to kiss me while I was
doing it and I would take out the pins and lay them
on the sheet and it would be loose and I would watch
her while she kept very still and then take out the last
two pins and it would all come down and she would
drop her head and we would both be inside of it and it
was the feeling of inside a tent or behind a falls

She had wonderfully beautiful hair and I would lie
sometimes and watch her twisting it up in the light that
came in the open door and it shone even in the night as
water shines sometimes just before it is really daylight
She had a lovely face and body and lovely smooth skin
too We would be lying together and I would touch
her cheeks and her forehead and under her eyes and
her chin and throat with the tips of my fingers and say
Smooth as piano keys and she would stroke my chin
with her finger and say Smooth as emery paper and
very hard on piano keys

Is it rough

No darling I was just making fun of you

It was lovely in the nights and if we could only
touch each other we were happy Besides all the big
times we had many small ways of making love and we
tried putting thoughts in the other ones head while we
were in different rooms It seemed to work sometimes
but that was probably because we were thinking the
same thing anyway

We said to each other that we were married the first
day she had come to the hospital and we counted




months from our wedding day I wanted to be really
married but Catherine said that if we were they would
send her away and if we merely started on the for
malities they would watch her and would break us up
We would have to be married under Italian law and
the formalities were terrific I wanted us to be married
really because I worried about having a child if I
thought about it but we pretended to ourselves we were
married and did not worry much and I suppose I en
joyed not being married really I know one night we
talked about it and Catherine said But darling
theyd send me away

Maybe they wouldnt

They would Theyd send me home and then we
would be apart until after the war

Id come on leave

CHAPTER XIX

The summer went that way I do not remember
much about the days except that they were hot and
that there were many victories in the papers I was
very healthy and my legs healed quickly so that it
was not very long after I was first on crutches be
fore I was through with them and walking with a cane
Then I started treatments at the Ospedale Maggiore
for bending the knees mechanical treatments baking
in a box of mirrors with violet rays massage and
baths I went over there afternoons and afterward
stopped at the cafe and had a drink and read the papers
I did not roam around the town but wanted to get
home to the hospital from the cafe All I wanted was to
see Catherine The rest of the time I was glad to kill
Mostly I slept in the mornings and in the afternoons
sometimes I went to the races and late to the mech
anotherapy treatments Sometimes I stopped in at
the AngloAmerican Club and sat in a deep leather
cushioned chair in front of the window and read the
magazines They would not let us go out together
when I was off crutches because it was unseemly for
a nurse to be seen unchaperoned with a patient who did
not look as though he needed attendance so we were
not together much in the afternoons Although some
times we could go out to dinner if Ferguson went
along Miss Van Campen had accepted the status that
we were great friends because she got a great amount
of work out of Catherine She thought Catherine
came from very good people and that prejudiced her
in her favor finally Miss Van Campen admired fam





ily very much and came from an excellent family her
self The hospital was quite busy too and that kept
her occupied It was a hot summer and I knew many
people in Milan but always was anxious to get back
home to the hospital as soon as the afternoon was over
At the front they were advancing on the Carso they
had taken Kuk across from Plava and were taking the
Bainsizza plateau The West front did not sound so
good It looked as though the war were going on for
a long time We were in the war now but I thought it
would take a year to get any great amount of troops
over and train them for combat Next year would be
a bad year or a good year maybe The Italians were
using up an awful amount of men I did not see how
it could go on Even if they took all the Bainsizza and
Monte San Gabriele there were plenty of mountains
beyond for the Austrians I had seen them All the
highest mountains were beyond On the Carso they
were going forward but there were marshes and
swamps down by the sea Napoleon would have
whipped the Austrians on the plains He never would
have fought them in the mountains He would have
let them come down and whipped them around Verona
Still nobody was whipping any one on the Western
front Perhaps wars werent won any more Maybe
they went on forever Maybe it was another Hundred
Years War I put the paper back on the rack and left
the club I went down the steps carefully and walked
up the Via Manzoni Outside the Gran Hotel I met
old Meyers and his wife getting out of a carriage They
were coming back from the races She was a big
busted woman in black satin He was short and old
with a white mustache and walked flatfooted with a
cane




How do you do How do you do She shook
hands Hello said Meyers

How were the races 

Fine They were just lovely I had three winners

How did you do I asked Meyers

All right I had a winner

I never know how he does Mrs Meyers said
He never tells me

I do all right Meyers said He was being cordial
You ought to come out While he talked you had the
impression that he was not looking at you or that he
mistook you for some one else

I will I said

Im coming up to the hospital to see you Mrs
Meyers said I have some things for my boys Youre
all my boys You certainly are my dear boys

Theyll be glad to see you

Those dear boys You too Youre one of my
boys

I have to get back I said

You give my love to all those dear boys Ive got
lots of things to bring Fve some fine Marsala and
cakes

Goodby I said Theyll be awfully glad to see
you

Goodby said Meyers You come around to the
galleria You know where my table is Were all there
every afternoon I went on up the street I wanted
to buy something at the Cova to take to Catherine In
side at the Cova I bought a box of chocolate and while
the girl wrapped it up I walked over to the bar There
were a couple of British and some aviators I had a
martini alone paid for it picked up the box of choco
late at the outside counter and walked on home toward




the hospital Outside the little bar up the street from
the Scala there were some people I knew a vicecon
sul two fellows who studied singing and Ettore Moretti
an Italian from San Francisco who was in the Italian
army I had a drink with them One of the singers
was named Ralph Simmons and he was singing under
the name of Enrico DelCredo I never knew how well
he could sing but he was always on the point of some
thing very big happening He was fat and looked
shopworn around the nose and mouth as though he
had hay fever He had come back from singing in
Piacenza He had sung Tosca and it had been won
derful

Of course youVe never heard me sing he said

When will you sing here

Til be at the Scala in the fall

Til bet they throw the benches at you Ettore said
Did you hear how they threw the benches at him in
Modena

Its a damned lie

They threw the benches at him Ettore said I
was there I threw six benches myself

Youre just a wop from Frisco

He cant pronounce Italian Ettore said Every
where he goes they throw the benches at him

Piacenzas the toughest house to sing in the north
of Italy the other tenor said Believe me thats a
tough little house to sing This tenors name was Ed
gar Saunders and he sang under the name of Edouardo
Giovanni

Id like to be there to see them throw the benches at
you Ettore said You cant sing Italian

Hes a nut said Edgar Saunders All he knows
how to say is throw benches




Thats all they know how to do when you two
sing Ettore said Then when you go to America
youll tell about your triumphs at the Scala They
wouldnt let you get by the first note at the Scala

Ill sing at the Scala Simmons said Im going
to sing Tosca in October

Well go wont we Mac Ettore said to the vice
consul Theyll need somebody to protect them

Maybe the American army will be there to protect
them the viceconsul said Do you want another
drink Simmons You want a drink Saunders

All right said Saunders

I hear youre going to get the silver medal Ettore
said to me What kind of citation you going to get

I dont know I dont know Im going to get it

Youre going to get it Oh boy the girls at the
Cova will think youre fine then Theyll all think you
killed two hundred Austrians or captured a whole
trench by yourself Believe me I got to work for my
decorations

How many have you got Ettore asked the vice
consul

Hes got everything Simmons said Hes the
boy theyre running the war for

Ive got the bronze twice and three silver medals
said Ettore But the papers on only one have come
through

Whats the matter with the others asked Sim
mons

The action wasnt successful said Ettore When
the action isnt successful they hold up all the medals

How many times have you been wounded Ettore 

Three times bad I got three wound stripes See




He pulled his sleeve around The stripes were parallel
silver lines on a black background sewed to the cloth
of the sleeve about eight inches below the shoulder

You got one too Ettore said to me Believe me
theyre fine to have Id rather have them than medals
Believe me boy when you get three youve got some
thing You only get one for a wound that puts you
three months in the hospital

Where were you wounded Ettore asked the vice
consul

Ettore pulled up his sleeve Here he showed the
deep smooth red scar Here on my leg I cant show
you that because I got puttees on and in the foot
Theres dead bone in my foot that stinks right now
Every morning I take new little pieces out and it stinks
all the time

What hit you asked Simmons

A handgrenade One of those potato mashers It
just blew the whole side of my foot off You know
those potato mashers He turned to me

Sure

I saw the son of a bitch throw it Ettore said It
knocked me down and I thought I was dead all right
but those damn potato mashers havent got anything
in them I shot the son of a bitch with my rifle I al
ways carry a rifle so they cant tell Im an officer

How did he look asked Simmons

That was the only one he had Ettore said I
dont know why he threw it I guess he always wanted
to throw one He never saw any real fighting probably
I shot the son of a bitch all right

How did he look when you shot him Simmons
asked

Hell how should I know said Ettore I shot him




in the belly I was afraid Id miss him if I shot him
in the head

How long have you been an officer Ettore I
asked

Two years Im going to be a captain How long
have you been a lieutenant

Going on three years

You cant be a captain because you dont know the
Italian language well enough Ettore said You can
talk but you cant read and write well enough You
got to have an education to be a captain Why dont
you go in the American army

Maybe I will

I wish to God I could Oh boy how much does a
captain get Mac

I dont know exactly Around two hundred and
fifty dollars I think

Jesus Christ what I could do with two hundred
and fifty dollars You better get in the American army
quick Fred See if you cant get me in

All right

I can command a company in Italian I could learn
it in English easy

Youd be a general said Simmons

No I dont know enough to be a general A gen
erals got to know a hell of a lot You guys think there
aint anything to war You aint got brains enough to
be a secondclass corporal

Thank God I dont have to be Simmons said

Maybe you will if they round up all you slackers
Oh boy Id like to have you two in my platoon Mac
too Id make you my orderly Mac

Youre a great boy Ettore Mac said But Im
afraid youre a militarist




Til be a colonel before the wars over Ettore said

If they dont kill you

They wont kill me He touched the stars at his
collar with his thumb and forefinger See me do that
We always touch our stars if anybody mentions get
ting killed

Lets go Sim said Saunders standing up

All right

So long I said I have to go too It was a
quarter to six by the clock inside the bar Ciaou Et
tore

Ciaou Fred said Ettore Thats pretty fine
youre going to get the silver medal

I dont know Ill get it

Youll get it all right Fred I heard you were go
ing to get it all right

Well so long I said Keep out of trouble Et
tore

Dont worry about me I dont drink and I dont
run around Im no boozer and whorehound I know
whats good for me

So long I said Im glad youre going to be pro
moted captain

I dont have to wait to be promoted Im going to
be a captain for merit of war You know Three stars
with the crossed swords and crown above Thats me

Good luck

Good luck When you going back to the front

Pretty soon

Well Ill see you around

So long

So long Dont take any bad nickels

I walked on down a back street that led to a cross
cut to the hospital Ettore was twentythree He had




been brought up by an uncle in San Francisco and was
visiting his father and mother in Torino when war was
declared He had a sister who had been sent to Amer
ica with him at the same time to live with the uncle
who would graduate from normal school this year
He was a legitimate hero who bored every one he met
Catherine could not stand him

We have heroes too she said But usually dar
ling theyre much quieter

I dont mind him

I wouldnt mind him if he wasnt so conceited and
didnt bore me and bore me and bore me

He bores me

Youre sweet to say so darling But you dont
need to You can picture him at the front and you
know hes useful but hes so much the type of boy I
dont care for

I know

Youre awfully sweet to know and I try and like
him but hes a dreadful dreadful boy really

He said this afternoon he was going to be a cap
tain

Im glad said Catherine That should please
him

Wouldnt you like me to have some more exalted
rank

No darling I only want you to have enough rank
so that were admitted to the better restaurants

Thats just the rank I have

You have a splendid rank I dont want you to
have any more rank It might go to your head Oh
darling Im awfully glad youre not conceited Id
have married you even if you were conceited but its
very restful to have a husband whos not conceited




We were talking softly out on the balcony The
moon was supposed to rise but there was a mist over
the town and it did not come up and in a little while
it started to drizzle and we came in Outside the mist
turned to rain and in a little while it was raining hard
and we heard it drumming on the roof I got up and
stood at the door to see if it was raining in but it wasnt
so I left the door open

Who else did you see Catherine asked

Mr and Mrs Meyers

Theyre a strange lot

Hes supposed to have been in the penitentiary at
home They let him out to die

And he lived happily in Milan forever after

I dont know how happily

Happily enough after jail I should think

Shes bringing some things here

She brings splendid things Were you her dear
boy

One of them

You are all her dear boys Catherine said She
prefers the dear boys Listen to it rain

Its raining hard

And youll always love me wont you

Yes

And the rain wont make any difference

No

Thats good Because Im afraid of the rain

Why I was sleepy Outside the rain was falling
steadily

I dont know darling Ive always been afraid of
the rain

I like it




I like to walk in it But its very hard on loving

Ill love you always

Ill love you in the rain and in the snow and in the
hail and  what else is there

I dont know I guess Im sleepy

Go to sleep darling and Ill love you no matter
how it is

Youre not really afraid of the rain are you

Not when Im with you

Why are you afraid of it

I dont know

Tell me

Dont make me

Tell me

No

Tell me

All right Im afraid of the rain because some
times I see me dead in it

No

And sometimes I see you dead in it

Thats more likely

No its not darling Because I can keep you safe
I know I can But nobody can help themselves

Please stop it I dont want you to get Scotch and
crazy tonight We wont be together much longer

No but I am Scotch and crazy But Ill stop it
Its all nonsense

Yes its all nonsense

Its all nonsense Its only nonsense Fm not afraid
of the rain Im not afraid of the rain Oh oh God
I wish I wasnt She was crying I comforted her
and she stopped crying But outside it kept on raining



CHAPTER XX

One day in the afternoon we went to the races Fer
guson went too and Crowell Rodgers the boy who had
been wounded in the eyes by the explosion of the shell
nosecap The girls dressed to go after lunch while
Crowell and I sat on the bed in his room and read the
past performances of the horses and the predictions in
the racing paper Crowells head was bandaged and
he did not care much about these races but read the rac
ing paper constantly and kept track of all the horses for
something to do He said the horses were a terrible
lot but they were all the horses we had Old Meyers
liked him and gave him tips Meyers won on nearly
every race but disliked to give tips because it brought
down the prices The racing was very crooked Men
who had been ruled off the turf everywhere else were
racing in Italy Meyers information was good but I
hated to ask him because sometimes he did not answer
and always you could see it hurt him to tell you but he
felt obligated to tell us for some reason and he hated
less to tell Crowell Crowells eyes had been hurt one
was hurt badly and Meyers had trouble with his eyes
and so he liked Crowell Meyers never told his wife
what horses he was playing and she won or lost mostly
lost and talked all the time

We four drove out to San Siro in an open carriage
It was a lovely day and we drove out through the park
and out along the tramway and out of town where the
road was dusty There were villas with iron fences and
big overgrown gardens and ditches with water flowing
and green vegetable gardens with dust on the leaves





We could look across the plain and see farmhouses
and the rich green farms with their irrigation ditches
and the mountains to the north There were many car
riages going into the race track and the men at the
gate let us in without cards because we were in uni
form We left the carriage bought programmes and
walked across the infield and then across the smooth
thick turf of the course to the paddock The grand
stands were old and made of wood and the betting
booths were under the stands and in a row out near the
stables There was a crowd of soldiers along the fence
in the infield The paddock was fairly well filled with
people and they were walking the horses around in a
ring under the trees behind the grand stand We saw
people we knew and got chairs for Ferguson and
Catherine and watched the horses

They went around one after the other their heads
down the grooms leading them One horse a purplish
black Crowell swore was dyed that color We
watched him and it seemed possible He had only
come out just before the bell rang to saddle We looked
him up in the programme from the number on the
grooms arm and it was listed a black gelding named
Japalac The race was for horses that had never won
a race worth one thousand lire or more Catherine
was sure his color had been changed Ferguson said
she could not tell I thought he looked suspicious We
all agreed we ought to back him and pooled one hun
dred lire The odds sheets showed he would pay thirty
five to one Crowell went over and bought the tickets
while we watched the jockeys ride around once more
and then go out under the trees to the track and gallop
slowly up to the turn where the start was to be

We went up in the grandstand to watch the race




They had no elastic barrier at San Siro then and tKi
starter lined up all the horses they looked very small
way up the track and then sent them off with a crack
of his long whip They came past us with the black
horse well in front and on the turn he was running
away from the others I watched them on the far side
with the glasses and saw the jockey fighting to hold
him in but he could not hold him and when they came
around the turn and into the stretch the black horse
was fifteen lengths ahead of the others He went way
on up and around the turn after the finish

Isnt it wonderful Catherine said Well have
over three thousand lire He must be a splendid horse

I hope his color doesnt run Crowell said before
they pay off

He was really a lovely horse Catherine said I
wonder if Mr Meyers backed him

Did you have the winner  I called to Meyers He
nodded

I didnt Mrs Meyers said Who did you children
bet on

Japalac

Really Hes thirtyfive to one

We liked his color

I didnt I thought he looked seedy They told me
not to back him

He wont pay much Meyers said

Hes marked thirtyfive to one in the quotes I said

He wont pay much At the last minute Meyers
said they put a lot of money on him

Who

Kempton and the boys Youll see He wont pay
two to one




Then we wont get three thousand lire Catherine
said I dont like this crooked racing

Well get two hundred lire

Thats nothing That doesnt do us any good I
thought we were going to get three thousand

Its crooked and disgusting Ferguson said

Of course said Catherine if it hadnt been
crooked wed never have backed him at all But I
would have liked the three thousand lire

Lets go down and get a drink and see what they
pay Crowell said We went out to where they posted
the numbers and the bell rang to pay off and they put
up 1850 after Japalac to win That meant he paid less
than even money on a tenlira bet

We went to the bar under the grand stand and had
a whiskey and soda apiece We ran into a couple of
Italians we knew and McAdams the viceconsul and
they came up with us when we joined the girls The
Italians were full of manners and McAdams talked to
Catherine while we went down to bet again Mr Mey
ers was standing near the parimutual

Ask him what he played I said to Crowell

What are you on Mr Meyers Crowell asked
Meyers took out his programme and pointed to the
number five with his pencil

Do you mind if we play him too Crowell asked

Go ahead Go ahead But dont tell my wife I
gave it to you

Will you have a drink I asked

No thanks I never drink

We put a hundred lire on number five to win and a
hundred to place and then had another whiskey and
soda apiece I was feeling very good and we picked up
a couple more Italians who each had a drink with us



i 4 o A FAREWELL TO ARMS

and went back to the girls These Italians were also
very mannered and matched manners with the two we
had collected before In a little while no one could sit
down I gave the tickets to Catherine

What horse is it

I dont know Mr Meyers choice

Dont you even know the name

No You can find it on the programme Number
five I think

You have touching faith she said The number
five won but did not pay anything Mr Meyers was
angry

You have to put up two hundred lire to make
twenty he said Twelve lire for ten Its not worth
it My wife lost twenty lire

Ill go down with you Catherine said to me The
Italians all stood up We went downstairs and out to
the paddock

Do you like this Catherine asked

Yes I guess I do

Its all right I suppose she said But darling I
cant stand to see so many people

We dont see many

No But those Meyers and the man from the bank
with his wife and daughters 

He cashes my sight drafts I said

Yes but some one else would if he didnt Those
last four boys were awful

We can stay out here and watch the race from the
fence

That will be lovely And darling lets back a horse
weve never heard of and that Mr Meyers wont be
backing

All right




We backed a horse named Light For Me that fin
ished fourth in a field of five We leaned on the fence
and watched the horses go by their hoofs thudding as
they went past and saw the mountains off in the dis
tance and Milan beyond the trees and the fields

I feel so much cleaner Catherine said The horses
were coming back through the gate wet and sweating
the jockeys quieting them and riding up to dismount
under the trees

Wouldnt you like a drink We could have one out
here and see the horses 

Til get them I said

The boy will bring them Catherine said She put
her hand up and the boy came out from the Pagoda
bar beside the stables We sat down at a round iron
table

Dont you like it better when were alone

Yes I said

I felt very lonely when they were all there

Its grand here I said

Yes Its really a pretty course

Its nice

Dont let me spoil your fun darling Ill go back
whenever you want

No I said Well stay here and have our drink
Then well go down and stand at the water jump for
the steeplechase

Youre awfully good to me she said

After we had been alone awhile we were glad to see
the others again We had a good time



CHAPTER XXI

In September the first cool nights came then the
days were cool and the leaves on the trees in the park
began to turn color and we knew the summer was gone
The fighting at the front went very badly and they
could not take San Gabriele The fighting on the Bain
sizza plateau was over and by the middle of the month
the fighting for San Gabriele was about over too They
could not take it Ettore was gone back to the front
The horses were gone to Rome and there was no more
racing Crowell had gone to Rome too to be sent back
to America There were riots twice in the town against
the war and bad rioting in Turin A British major at
the club told me the Italians had lost one hundred and
fifty thousand men on the Bainsizza plateau and on
San Gabriele He said they had lost forty thousand
on the Carso besides We had a drink and he talked
He said the fighting was over for the year down here
and that the Italians had bitten off more than they
could chew He said the offensive in Flanders was go
ing to the bad If they killed men as they did this fall
the Allies would be cooked in another year He said
we were all cooked but we were all right as long as we
did not know it We were all cooked The thing was
not to recognize it The last country to realize they
were cooked would win the war We had another
drink Was I on somebodys staff No He was It
was all balls We were alone in the club sitting back in
one of the big leather sofas His boots were smoothly
polished dull leather They were beautiful boots He
said it was all balls They thought only in divisions





and manpower They all squabbled about divisions
and only killed them when they got them They were
all cooked The Germans won the victories By God
they were soldiers The old Hun was a soldier But
they were cooked too We were all cooked I asked
about Russia He said they were cooked already Id
soon see they were cooked Then the Austrians were
cooked too If they got some Hun divisions they could
do it Did he think they would attack this fall Of
course they would The Italians were cooked Every
body knew they were cooked The old Hun would come
down through the Trentino and cut the railway at Vi
cenza and then where would the Italians be They
tried that in sixteen I said Not with Germans Yes
I said But they probably wouldnt do that he said
It was too simple Theyd try something complicated
and get royally cooked I had to go I said I had to
get back to the hospital Goodby he said Then
cheerily Every sort of luck  There was a great con
trast between his world pessimism and personal cheeri
ness

I stopped at a barber shop and was shaved and went
home to the hospital My leg was as well as it would
get for a long time I had been up for examination
three days before There were still some treatments to
take before my course at the Ospedale Maggiore was
finished and I walked along the side street practising
not limping An old man was cutting silhouettes under
an arcade I stopped to watch him Two girls were
posing and he cut their silhouettes together snipping
very fast and looking at them his head on one side
The girls were giggling He showed me the silhou
ettes before he pasted them on white paper and handed
them to the girls




Theyre beautiful he said How about you
Tenente 

The girls went away looking at their silhouettes and
laughing They were nicelooking girls One of them
worked in the wine shop across from the hospital

All right I said

Take your cap off

No With it on

It will not be so beautiful the old man said But
he brightened it will be more military

He snipped away at the black paper then separated
the two thicknesses and pasted the profiles on a card
and handed them to me

How much

Thats all right He waved his hand I just made
them for you

Please I brought out some coppers For plea
sure

No I did them for a pleasure Give them to your
girl

Many thanks until we meet

Until I see thee

I went on to the hospital There were some letters
an official one and some others I was to have three
weeks convalescent leave and then return to the front
I read it over carefully Well that was that The con
valescent leave started October fourth when my course
was finished Three weeks was twentyone days That
made October twentyfifth I told them I would not
be in and went to the restaurant a little way up the
street from the hospital for supper and read my letters
and the Corriere Delia Sera at the table There was a
letter from my grandfather containing family news




patriotic encouragement a draft for two hundred dol
lars and a few clippings  a dull letter from the priest
at our mess a letter from a man I knew who was flying
with the French and had gotten in with a wild gang
and was telling about it and a note from Rinaldi ask
ing me how long I was going to skulk in Milano and
what was all the news He wanted me to bring him
phonograph records and enclosed a list I drank a
small bottle of chianti with the meal had a coffee after
ward with a glass of cognac finished the paper put my
letters in my pocket left the paper on the table with
the tip and went out In my room at the hospital I un
dressed put on pajamas and a dressinggown pulled
down the curtains on the door that opened onto the bal
cony and sitting up in bed read Boston papers from a
pile Mrs Meyers had left for her boys at the hospital
The Chicago White Sox were winning the American
League pennant and the New York Giants were lead
ing the National League Babe Ruth was a pitcher
then playing for Boston The papers were dull the
news was local and stale and the war news was all old
The American news was all training camps I was glad
I wasnt in a training camp The baseball news was
all I could read and I did not have the slightest interest
in it A number of papers together made it impossible
to read with interest It was not very timely but I read
at it for a while I wondered if America really got
into the war if they would close down the major
leagues They probably wouldnt There was still rac
ing in Milan and the war could not be much worse
They had stopped racing in France That was where
our horse Japalac came from Catherine was not due
on duty until nine oclock I heard her passing along
the floor when she first came on duty and once saw her




pass in the hall She went to several other rooms and
finally came into mine

Im late darling she said There was a lot to do
How are you

I told her about my papers and the leave

Thats lovely she said Where do you want to
go

Nowhere I want to stay here

Thats silly You pick a place to go and Ill come
too

How will you work it

I dont know But I will

Youre pretty wonderful

I should think it might be hard to manage

No it wont darling If necessary Ill simply leave
But it wont come to that

Where should we go

I dont care Anywhere you want Anywhere we
dont know people

She seemed upset and taut

if you pick out a place for us to go It ought to be
lovely in October Well have a lovely time darling
and Ill write you every day while youre at the front

Where will you be

I dont know yet But somewhere splendid Ill
look after all that

We were quiet awhile and did not talk Catherine
was sitting on the bed and I was looking at her but we
did not touch each other We were apart as when some
one comes into a room and people are selfconscious
She put out her hand and took mine

You arent angry are you darling

No

And you dont feel trapped 

Maybe a little But not by you

I didnt mean by me You mustnt be stupid I
meant trapped at all

You always feel trapped biologically

She went away a long way without stirring or re
moving her hand

 Always isnt a pretty word

Im sorry

Its all right But you see Ive never had a baby
and Ive never even loved any one And Ive tried to be
the way you wanted and then you talk about always 

I could cut off my tongue I offered

Oh darling she came back from wherever she
had been You mustnt mind me We were both to
gether again and the self consciousness was gone We




really are the same one and we mustnt misunderstand
on purpose 

We wont

But people do They love each other and they mis
understand on purpose and they fight and then sud
denly they arent the same one

We wont fight

We mustnt Because theres only us two and in
the world theres all the rest of them If anything
comes between us were gone and then they have us

They wont get us I said Because youre too
brave Nothing ever happens to the brave

They die of course

But only once

I dont know Who said that

The coward dies a thousand deaths the brave but
one

Of course Who said it

I dont know

He was probably a coward she said He knew
a great deal about cowards but nothing about the brave
The brave dies perhaps two thousand deaths if hes in
telligent He simply doesnt mention them

I dont know Its hard to see inside the head of
the brave

Yes Thats how they keep that way

Youre an authority

Youre right darling That was deserved

Youre brave

No she said But I would like to be

Im not I said I know where I stand Ive been
out long enough to know Im like a ballplayer that
bats two hundred and thirty and knows hes no better




What is a ballplayer that bats two hundred and
thirty Ifs awfully impressive

Its not It means a mediocre hitter in baseball

But still a hitter she prodded me

I guess were both conceited I said But you are
brave

No But I hope to be

Were both brave I said And Im very brave
when Ive had a drink

Were splendid people Catherine said She went
over to the armoire and brought me the cognac and a
glass Have a drink darling she said Youve
been awfully good

I dont really want one

Take one

All right I poured the water glass a third full
of cognac and drank it off

That was very big she said I know brandy is
for heroes But you shouldnt exaggerate

Where will we live after the war

In an old peoples home probably she said For
three years I looked forward very childishly to the war
ending at Christmas But now I look forward till when
our son will be a lieutenant commander

Maybe hell be a general

If its an hundred years war hell have time to try
both of the services

Dont you want a drink

No It always makes you happy darling and it
only makes me dizzy

Didnt you ever drink brandy

No darling Im a very oldfashioned wife

I reached down to the floor for the bottle and poured
another drink




Id better go to have a look at your compatriots 
Catherine said Perhaps youll read the papers until
I come back

Do you have to go

Now or later

All right Now

Fll come back later

Fll have finished the papers I said



CHAPTER XXII

It turned cold that night and the next day it was
raining Coming home from the Ospedale Maggiore
it rained very hard and I was wet when I came in Up
in my room the rain was coming down heavily outside
on the balcony and the wind blew it against the glass
doors I changed my clothing and drank some brandy
but the brandy did not taste good I felt sick in the
night and in the morning after breakfast I was nau
seated

There is no doubt about it the house surgeon said
Look at the whites of his eyes Miss

Miss Gage looked They had me look in a glass The
whites of the eyes were yellow and it was the jaundice
I was sick for two weeks with it For that reason we
did not spend a convalescent leave together We had
planned to go to Pallanza on Lago Maggiore It is
nice there in the fall when the leaves turn There are
walks you can take and you can troll for trout in the
lake It would have been better than Stresa because
there are fewer people at Pallanza Stresa is so easy
to get to from Milan that there are always people you
know There is a nice village at Pallanza and you can
row out to the islands where the fishermen live and
there is a restaurant on the biggest island But we
did not go

One day while I was in bed with jaundice Miss Van
Campen came in the room opened the door into the
armoire and saw the empty bottles there I had sent a
load of them down by the porter and I believe she must
have seen them going out and come up to find some





more They were mostly vermouth bottles marsala bot
tles capri bottles empty chianti flasks and a few cognac
bottles The porter had carried out the large bottles
those that had held vermouth and the strawcovered
chianti flasks and left the brandy bottles for the last
It was the brandy bottles and a bottle shaped like a bear
which had held kummel that Miss Van Campen found
The bearshaped bottle enraged her particularly She
held it up the bear was sitting up on his haunches with
his paw r s up there was a cork in his glass head and a
few sticky crystals at the bottom I laughed

It was kummel I said The best kummel comes
in those bearshaped bottles It comes from Russia

Those are all brandy bottles arent they Miss
Van Campen asked

I cant see them all I said But they probably
are

How long has this been going on

I bought them and brought them in myself I said
I have had Italian officers visit me frequently and I
have kept brandy to offer them

You havent been drinking it yourself she said

I have also drunk it myself

Brandy she said Eleven empty bottles of brandy
and that bear liquid

Kummel

I will send for some one to take them away Those
are all the empty bottles you have

For the moment

And I was pitying you having jaundice Pity is
something that is wasted on you

Thank you

I suppose you cant be blamed for not wanting to
go back to the front But I should think you would




try something more intelligent than producing jaun
dice with alcoholism

With what

With alcoholism You heard me say it I did
not say anything Unless you find something else Im
afraid you will have to go back to the front when
you are through with your jaundice I dont believe
selfinflicted jaundice entitles you to a convalescent
leave

You dont

I do not

Have you ever had jaundice Miss Van Campen

No but I have seen a great deal of it

You noticed how the patients enjoyed it

I suppose it is better than the front

Miss Van Campen I said did you ever know a
man who tried to disable himself by kicking himself
in the scrotum

Miss Van Campen ignored the actual question She
had to ignore it or leave the room She was not ready
to leave because she had disliked me for a long time
and she was now cashing in

I have known many men to escape the front through
selfinflicted wounds

That wasnt the question I have seen selfinflicted
wounds also I asked you if you had ever known a
man who had tried to disable himself by kicking him
self in the scrotum Because that is the nearest sensa
tion to jaundice and it is a sensation that I believe few
women have ever experienced That was why I asked
you if you had ever had the jaundice Miss Van
Campen because   Miss Van Campen left the room
Later Miss Gage came in




What did you say to Van Campen  She was furi
ous

We were comparing sensations I was going to
suggest that she had never experienced childbirth 

Youre a fool Gage said Shes after your scalp

She has my scalp I said Shes lost me my leave
and she might try and get me courtmartialled Shes
mean enough

She never liked you Gage said Whats it
about

She says Ive drunk myself into jaundice so as
not to go back to the front

Pooh said Gage Ill swear youve never taken
a drink Everybody will swear youve never taken a
drink

She found the bottles

Ive told you a hundred times to clear out those
bottles Where are they now

In the armoire

Have you a suitcase

No Put them in that rucksack

Miss Gage packed the bottles in the rucksack Ill
give them to the porter she said She started for the
door

Just a minute Miss Van Campen said Ill take
those bottles She had the porter with her Carry
them please she said I want to show them to the
doctor when I make my report

She went down the hall The porter carried the sack
He knew what was in it

Nothing happened except that I lost my leave



CHAPTER XXIII

The night I was to return to the front I sent the
porter down to hold a seat for me on the train when it
came from Turin The traijw T as to leave at midnight
It was made up at Turin ailsreached Milan about half
past ten at night and lay in the station until time to
leave You had to be there when it came in to get a
seat The porter took a friend with him a machine
gunner on leave who worked in a tailor shop and was
sure that between them they could hold a place I gave
them money for platform tickets and had them take my
baggage There was a big rucksack and two musettes

I said goodby at the hospital at about five oclock
and went out The porter had my baggage in his lodge
T told him I would be at the station a little before
rmuiiight His wife called me Signorino and cried
She wiped her eyes and shook hands and then cried
again I patted her on the back and she cried once
more She had done my mending and was a very short
dumpy happy faced woman with w r hite hair When she
cried her whole face went to pieces I went down to
the corner where there was a wine shop and waited in
side looking out the window It was dark outside and
cold and misty I paid for my coffee and grappa and
I watched the people going by in the light from the
window I saw Catherine and knocked on the window
She looked saw me and smiled and I went out to meet
her She was wearing a dark blue cape and a soft felt
hat We walked along together along the sidewalk
past the wine shops then across the market square and
up the street and through the archway to the cathedral





square There were streetcar tracks and beyond them
was the cathedral It was white and wet in the mist
We crossed the tram tracks On our left were the
shops their windows lighted and the entrance to the
galleria There was a fog in the square and when we
came close to the front of the cathedral it was very big
and the stone was wet

 Would you like to go in

No Catherine said We walked along There was
a soldier standing with his girl in the shadow of one of
the stone buttresses ahead of us and we passed them
They were standing tight up against the stone and he
had put his cape around her

Theyre like us I said

Nobody is like us Catherine said She did not
mean it happily

I wish they had some place to go

It mightnt do them any good

I dont know Everybody ought to have some place
to go

They have the cathedral Catherine said We were
past it now We crossed the far end of the square and
looked back at the cathedral It was fine in the mist
We were standing in front of the leather goods shop
There were riding boots a rucksack and ski boots in
the window Each article was set apart as an exhibit 
the rucksack in the centre the riding boots on one side
and the ski boots on the other The leather was dark
and oiled smooth as a used saddle The electric light
made high lights on the dull oiled leather

Well ski some time

In two months there will be skiing at Murren
Catherine said

Lets go there





All right she said We went on past other win
dows and turned down a side street

Ive never been this way

This is the way I go to the hospital I said It was
a narrow street and we kept on the righthand side
There were many people passing in the fog There
were shops and all the windows were lighted We
looked in a window at a pile of cheeses I stopped in
front of an armorers shop

Come in a minute I have to buy a gun

What sort of gun

A pistol We went in and I unbuttoned my belt
and laid it with the empty holster on the counter Two
women were behind the counter The women brought
out several pistols

It must fit this I said opening the holster It
was a gray leather holster and I had bought it second
hand to wear in the town

Have they good pistols Catherine asked

Theyre all about the same Can I try this one
I asked the woman

I have no place now to shoot she said But it
is very good You will not make a mistake with it

I snapped it and pulled back the action The spring
was rather strong but it worked smoothly I sighted
it and snapped it again

It is used the woman said It belonged to an of
ficer who was an excellent shot

Did you sell it to him

Yes

How did you get it back

From his orderly

Maybe you have mine I said How much is
this




Fifty lire It is very cheap

All right I want two extra clips and a box of
cartridges

She brought them from under the counter

Have you any need for a sword she asked I
have some used swords very cheap

Im going to the front I said

Oh yes then you wont need a sword she said

I paid for the cartridges and the pistol filled the
magazine and put it in place put the pistol in my empty
holster filled the extra clips with cartridges and put
them in the leather slots on the holster and then buckled
on my belt The pistol felt heavy on the belt Still I
thought it was better to have a regulation pistol You
could always get shells

Now were fully armed I said That was the one
thing I had to remember to do Some one got my
other one going to the hospital

I hope its a good pistol Catherine said

Was there anything else the woman asked

I dont believe so

The pistol has a lanyard she said

So I noticed The woman wanted to sell some
thing else

You dont need a whistle

I dont believe so

The woman said goodby and we went out onto the
sidewalk Catherine looked in the window The wo
man looked out and bowed to us

What are those little mirrors set in wood for

Theyre for attracting birds They twirl them out
in the field and larks see them and come out and the
Italians shoot them

They are an ingenious people Catherine said



i6o A FAREWELL TO ARMS

You dont shoot larks do you darling in America 

Not especially

We crossed the street and started to walk up the
other side

I feel better now Catherine said I felt terrible
when we started

We always feel good when were together

We always will be together

Yes except that Im going away at midnight

Dont think about it darling

We walked on up the street The fog made the lights
yellow

Arent you tired Catherine asked

How about you

Im all right Its fun to walk

But lets not do it too long

No

We turned down a side street where there were no
lights and walked in the street I stopped and kissed
Catherine While I kissed her I felt her hand on my
shoulder She had pulled my cape around her so it
covered both of us We were standing in the street
against a high wall

Lets go some place I said

Good said Catherine We walked on along the
street until it came out onto a wider street that was
beside a canal On the other side was a brick wall and
buildings Ahead down the street I saw a streetcar
cross a bridge

We can get a cab up at the bridge I said We
stood on the bridge in the fog waiting for a carriage
Several streetcars passed full of people going home
Then a carriage came along but there was some one in
it The fog was turning to rain




We could walk or take a tram Catherine said

One will be along I said They go by here

Here one comes she said

The driver stopped his horse and lowered the metal
sign on his meter The top of the carriage was up and
there were drops of water on the drivers coat His
varnished hat was shining in the wet We sat back in
the seat together and the top of the carriage made it
dark

Where did you tell him to go

To the station Theres a hotel across from the sta
tion where we can go

We can go the way we are Without luggage

Yes I said

It was a long ride to the station up side streets in the
rain

Wont we have dinner Catherine asked Im
afraid Ill be hungry

Well have it in our room

I havent anything to wear I havent even a night
gown

Well get one I said and called to the driver

Go to the Via Manzoni and up that He nodded
and turned off to the left at the next corner On the
big street Catherine watched for a shop

Heres a place she said I stopped the driver and
Catherine got out walked across the sidewalk and went
inside I sat back in the carriage and waited for her
It was raining and I could smell the wet street and the
horse steaming in the rain She came back with a
package and got in and we drove on

I was very extravagant darling she said but its
a fine nightgown

At the hotel I asked Catherine to wait in the carriage




while I went in and spoke to the manager There were
plenty of rooms Then I went out to the carriage paid
the driver and Catherine and I walked in together
The small boy in buttons carried the package The
manager bowed us toward the elevator There was
much red plush and brass The manager went up in the
elevator with us

Monsieur and Madame wish dinner in their room

Yes Will you have the menu brought up I said

You wish something special for dinner Some
game or a soufflet

The elevator passed three floors with a click each
time then clicked and stopped

What have you as game

I could get a pheasant or a woodcock

A woodcock I said We walked down the corri
dor The carpet was worn There were many doors The
manager stopped and unlocked a door and opened it

Here you are A lovely room

The small boy in buttons put the package on the table
in the centre of the room The manager opened the
curtains

It is foggy outside he said The room was fur
nished in red plush There were many mirrors two
chairs and a large bed with a satin coverlet A door
led to the bathroom

I will send up the menu the manager said He
bowed and went out

I went to the window and looked out then pulled a
cord that shut the thick plush curtains Catherine was
sitting on the bed looking at the cut glass chandelier
She had taken her hat off and her hair shone under the
light She saw herself in one of the mirrors and put
her hands to her hair I saw her in three other mir




rors She did not look happy She let her cape fall on
the bed

 Whats the matter darling 

I never felt like a whore before she said I went
over to the window and pulled the curtain aside and
looked out I had not thought it would be like this

Youre not a whore

I know it darling But it isnt nice to feel like one
Her voice was dry and flat

This was the best hotel we could get in I said I
looked out the window Across the square were the
lights of the station There were carriages going by
on the street and I saw the trees in the park The lights
from the hotel shone on the wet pavement Oh hell
I thought do we have to argue now 

Come over here please Catherine said The flat
ness was all gone out of her voice Come over please
Im a good girl again I looked over at the bed She
was smiling

I went over and sat on the bed beside her and kissed
her

Youre my good girl

Im certainly yours she said

After we had eaten we felt fine and then after we
felt very happy and in a little time the room felt like
our own home My room at the hospital had been our
own home and this room was our home too in the same
way

Catherine wore my tunic over her shoulders while
we ate We were very hungry and the meal was good
and we drank a bottle of Capri and a bottle of St
Estephe I drank most of it but Catherine drank some
and it made her feel splendid For dinner we had a




woodcock with souffle potatoes and puree de marron a
salad and zabaione for dessert

Its a fine room Catherine said Its a lovely
room We should have stayed here all the time weve
been in Milan

Its a funny room But its nice

Vice is a wonderful thing Catherine said The
people who go in for it seem to have good taste about
it The red plush is really fine Its just the thing
And the mirrors are very attractive

Youre a lovely girl

I dont know how a room like this would be for
waking up in the morning But its really a splendid
room I poured another glass of St Estephe

I wish we could do something really sinful Cath
erine said Everything we do seems so innocent and
simple I cant believe we do anything wrong

Youre a grand girl

I only feel hungry I get terribly hungry

Youre a fine simple girl I said

I am a simple girl No one ever understood it ex
cept you

Once when I first met you I spent an afternoon
thinking how we would go to the Hotel Cavour to
gether and how it would be

That was awfully cheeky of you This isnt the
Cavour is it

No They wouldnt have taken us in there

Theyll take us in some time But thats how we
differ darling I never thought about anything

Didnt you ever at all

A little she said

Oh youre a lovely girl

I poured another glass of wine




Im a very simple girl Catherine said

I didnt think so at first I thought you were a
crazy girl

I was a little crazy But I wasnt crazy in any com
plicated manner I didnt confuse you did I darling

Wine is a grand thing I said It makes you for
get all the bad

Its lovely said Catherine But its given my fa
ther gout very badly

Have you a father

Yes said Catherine He has gout You wont
ever have to meet him Havent you a father

No I said A stepfather

Will I like him

You wont have to meet him

We have such a fine time Catherine said I dont
take any interest in anything else any more Im so
very happy married to you

The waiter came and took away the things After a
while we were very still and we could hear the rain
Down below on the street a motor car honked

 But at my back I always hear

Times winged chariot hurrying near 

I said

I know that poem Catherine said Its by Marvell
But its about a girl who wouldnt live with a man

My head felt very clear and cold and I wanted to
talk facts

Where will you have the baby

I dont know The best place I can find

How will you arrange it

The best way I can Dont worry darling We
may have several babies before the war is over




Its nearly time to go

I know You can make it time if you want

No

Then dont worry darling You were fine until now
and now youre worrying

I wont How often will you write

Every day Do they read your letters

They cant read English enough to hurt any

Ill make them very confusing Catherine said

But not too confusing

Ill just make them a little confusing

Im afraid we have to start to go

All right darling

I hate to leave our fine house

So do I

But we have to go

AH right But were never settled in our home
very long

We will be

Ill have a fine home for you when you come back

Maybe Ill be back right away

Perhaps youll be hurt just a little in the foot

Or the lobe of the ear

No I want your ears the way they are

And not my feet

Your feet have been hit already

We have to go darling Really

All right You go first



CHAPTER XXIV

We walked down the stairs instead of taking the
elevator The carpet on the stairs was worn I had
paid for the dinner when it came up and the waiter
who had brought it was sitting on a chair near the
door He jumped up and bowed and I went with him
into the side room and paid the bill for the room The
manager had remembered me as a friend and refused
payment in advance but when he retired he had remem
bered to have the waiter stationed at the door so that
I should not get out without paying I suppose that
had happened  even with his friends One had so many
friends in a war

I asked the waiter to get us a carriage and he took
Catherines package that I was carrying and went out
with an umbrella Outside through the window we
saw him crossing the street in the rain We stood in
the side room and looked out the window

How do you feel Cat

Sleepy

I feel hollow and hungry

Have you anything to eat

Yes in my musette

I saw the carriage coming It stopped the horses
head hanging in the rain and the waiter stepped out
opened his umbrella and came toward the hotel We
met him at the door and walked out under the um
brella down the wet walk to the carriage at the curb
Water was running in the gutter

There is your package on the seat the waiter said
He stood with the umbrella until we were in and I had
tipped him





Many thanks Pleasant journey he said The
coachman lifted the reins and the horse started The
waiter turned away under the umbrella and went to
ward the hotel We drove down the street and turned
to the left then came around to the right in front of
the station There were two carabinieri standing under
the light just out of the rain The light shone on their
hats The rain was clear and transparent against the
light from the station A porter came out from under
the shelter of the station his shoulders up against the
rain

No I said Thanks I dont need thee

He went back under the shelter of the archway I
turned to Catherine Her face was in the shadow from
the hood of the carriage

We might as well say goodby

I cant go in

No

Goodby Cat

Will you tell him the hospital

Yes

I told the driver the address to drive to He
nodded

Goodby I said Take good care of yourself and
young Catherine

Goodby darling

Goodby I said I stepped out into the rain and
the carriage started Catherine leaned out and I saw
her face in the light She smiled and waved The
carriage went up the street Catherine pointed in to
ward the archway I looked there were only the two
carabinieri and the archway I realized she meant for
me to get in out of the rain I went in and stood and
watched the carriage turn the corner Then I started




through the station and down the runway to the train

The porter was on the platform looking for me I
followed him into the train crowding past people and
along the aisle and in through a door to where the
machinegunner sat in the corner of a full compart
ment My rucksack and musettes were above his head
on the luggage rack There were many men standing
in the corridor and the men in the compartment all
looked at us when we came in There were not enough
places in the train and every one was hostile The ma
chinegunner stood up for me to sit down Some one
tapped me on the shoulder I looked around It was
a very tall gaunt captain of artillery with a red scar
along his jaw He had looked through the glass on the
corridor and then come in

What do you say I asked I had turned and
faced him He was taller than I and his face was
very thin under the shadow of his capvisor and the
scar was new and shiny Every one in the compart
ment was looking at me

You cant do that he said You cant have a
soldier save you a place

I have done it

He swallowed and I saw his Adams apple go up
and then down The machinegunner stood in front of
the place Other men looked in through the glass No
one in the compartment said anything

You have no right to do that I was here two hours
before you came

What do you want

The seat

So do I

I watched his face and could feel the whole com
partment against me I did not blame them He was




in the right But I wanted the seat Still no one said
anything

Oh hell I thought

Sit down Signor Capitano I said The machine
gunner moved out of the way and the tall captain sat
down He looked at me His face seemed hurt But
he had the seat Get my things I said to the ma
chinegunner We went out in the corridor The train
was full and I knew there was no chance of a place I
gave the porter and the machinegunner ten lire apiece
They went down the corridor and outside on the plat
form looking in the windows but there were no places

Maybe some will get off at Brescia the porter
said

More will get on at Brescia said the machine
gunner I said goodby to them and we shook hands
and they left They both felt badly Inside the train
we were all standing in the corridor when the train
started I watched the lights of the station and the
yards as we went out It was still raining and soon the
windows were wet and you could not see out Later
I slept on the floor of the corridor first putting my
pocketbook with my money and papers in it inside my
shirt and trousers so that it was inside the leg of my
breeches I slept all night waking at Brescia and
Verona when more men got on the train but going back
to sleep at once I had my head on one of the musettes
and my arms around the other and I could feel the
pack and they could all walk over me if they wouldnt
step on me Men were sleeping on the floor all down
the corridor Others stood holding on to the window
rods or leaning against the doors That train was al
ways crowded



BOOK III



CHAPTER XXV

Now in the fall the trees were all bare and the roads
were muddy I rode to Gorizia from Udine on a
camion We passed other camions on the road and I
looked at the country The mulberry trees were bare
and the fields were brown There were wet dead leaves
on the road from the rows of bare trees and men were
working on the road tamping stone in the ruts from
piles of crushed stone along the side of the road be
tween the trees We saw the town with a mist over it
that cut off the mountains We crossed the river and I
saw that it was running high It had been raining in
the mountains We came into the town past the fac
tories and then the houses and villas and I saw that
many more houses had been hit On a narrow street we
passed a British Red Cross ambulance The driver
wore a cap and his face was thin and very tanned I
did not know him I got down from the camion in
the big square in front of the Town Majors house the
driver handed down my rucksack and I put it on and
swung on the two musettes and walked to our villa It
did not feel like a homecoming

I walked down the damp gravel driveway looking
at the villa through the trees The windows were all
shut but the door was open I went in and found the
major sitting at a table in the bare room with maps and
typed sheets of paper on the wall

Hello he said How are you He looked older
and drier

Im good I said How is everything

Its all over he said Take off your kit and sit




down I put my pack and the two musettes on the
floor and my cap on the pack I brought the other
chair over from the wall and sat down by the desk

Its been a bad summer the major said Are you
strong now 

Yes

Did you ever get the decorations

Yes I got them fine Thank you very much

Lets see them

I opened my cape so he could see the two ribbons

Did you get the boxes with the medals

No Just the papers

The boxes will come later That takes more time

What do you want me to do

The cars are all away There are six up north at
Caporetto You know Caporetto

Yes I said I remembered it as a little white town
with a campanile in a valley It was a clean little town
and there was a fine fountain in the square

They are working from there There are many sick
now The fighting is over

Where are the others

There are two up in the mountains and four still
on the Bainsizza The other two ambulance sections
are in the Carso with the third army

What do you wish me to do

You can go and take over the four cars on the
Bainsizza if you like Gino has been up there a long
time You havent seen it up there have you

No

It was very bad We lost three cars

I heard about it

Yes Rinaldi wrote you




Where is Rinaldi

He is here at the hospital He has had a summer
and fall of it

I believe it

It has been bad the major said You couldnt
believe how bad its been Ive often thought you were
lucky to be hit when you were

I know I was

Next year will be worse the major said Per
haps they will attack now They say they are to attack
but I cant believe it It is too late You saw the
river

Yes Its high already

I dont believe they will attack now that the rains
have started We will have the snow soon What
about your countrymen Will there be other Ameri
cans besides yourself

They are training an army of ten million

I hope we get some of them But the French will
hog them all Well never get any down here All
right You stay here tonight and go out tomorrow
with the little car and send Gino back Ill send some
body with you that knows the road Gino will tell you
everything They are shelling quite a little still but it
is all over You will want to see the Bainsizza

Im glad to see it I am glad to be back with you
again Signor Maggiore

He smiled You are very good to say so I am
very tired of this war If I was away I do not believe
I would come back

Is it so bad

Yes It is so bad and worse Go get cleaned up
and find your friend Rinaldi

I went out and carried my bags up the stairs Ri




naldi was not in the room but his things were there and
I sat down on the bed and unwrapped my puttees and
took the shoe off my right foot Then I lay back on the
bed I was tired and my right foot hurt It seemed
silly to lie on the bed with one shoe off so I sat up and
unlaced the other shoe and dropped it on the floor then
lay back on the blanket again The room was stuffy
with the window closed but I was too tired to get up
and open it I saw my things were all in one corner of
the room Outside it was getting dark I lay on the
bed and thought about Catherine and waited for Ri
naldi I was going to try not to think about Catherine
except at night before I went to sleep But now I was
tired and there was nothing to do so I lay and thought
about her I was thinking about her when Rinaldi
came in He looked just the same Perhaps he was a
little thinner

Well baby he said I sat up on the bed He
came over sat down and put his arm around me
Good old baby He whacked me on the back and
I held both his arms

Old baby he said Let me see your knee

Ill have to take off my pants

Take off your pants baby Were all friends here
I want to see what kind of a job they did I stood up
took off the breeches and pulled off the kneebrace
Rinaldi sat on the floor and bent the knee gently back
and forth He ran his finger along the scar put his
thumbs together over the kneecap and rocked the knee
gently with his fingers

Is that all the articulation you have

Yes

Its a crime to send you back They ought to get
complete articulation




Its a lot better than it was It was stiff as a
board

Rinaldi bent it more I watched his hands He had
fine surgeons hands I looked at the top of his head
his hair shiny and parted smoothly He bent the knee
too far

Ouch I said

You ought to have more treatment on it with the
machines Rinaldi said

Its better than it was

I see that baby This is something I know more
about than you He stood up and sat down on the
bed The knee itself is a good job He was through
with the knee Tell me all about everything

Theres nothing to tell I said Ive led a quiet
life

You act like a married man he said Whats the
matter with you

Nothing I said Whats the matter with you

This war is killing me Rinaldi said I am very
depressed by it He folded his hands over his knee

Oh I said

Whats the matter Cant I even have human im
pulses 

No I can see youve been having a fine time Tell
me

All summer and all fall Ive operated I work all
the time I do everybodys work All the hard ones
they leave to me By God baby I am becoming a
lovely surgeon

That sounds better

I never think No by God I dont think I oper
ate

Thats right




But now baby its all over I dont operate now
and I feel like hell This is a terrible war baby You
believe me when I say it Now you cheer me up Did
you bring the phonograph records 

Yes

They were wrapped in paper in a cardboard box in
my rucksack I was too tired to get them out

Dont you feel good yourself baby

I feel like hell

This war is terrible Rinaldi said Come on
Well both get drunk and be cheerful Then well go
get the ashes dragged Then well feel fine

Ive had the jaundice I said and I cant get
drunk

Oh baby how youve come back to me You come
back serious and with a liver I tell you this war is a
bad thing Why did we make it anyway

Well have a drink I dont want to get drunk but
well have a drink

Rinaldi went across the room to the washstand and
brought back two glasses and a bottle of cognac

Its Austrian cognac he said Seven stars Its
all they captured on San Gabriele

Were you up there

No I havent been anywhere Ive been here all
the time operating Look baby this is your old tooth
brushing glass I kept it all the time to remind me of
you

To remind you to brush your teeth

No I have my own too I kept this to remind
me of you trying to brush away the Villa Rossa from
your teeth in the morning swearing and eating aspi
rin and cursing harlots Every time I see that glass I
think of you trying to clean your conscience with a




toothbrush He came over to the bed Kiss me
once and tell me youre not serious

I never kiss you Youre an ape

I know you are the fine good AngloSaxon boy I
know You are the remorse boy I know I will wait
till I see the AngloSaxon brushing away harlotry
with a toothbrush

Put some cognac in the glass

We touched glasses and drank Rinaldi laughed at
me

I will get you drunk and take out your liver and put
you in a good Italian liver and make you a man
again

I held the glass for some more cognac It was dark
outside now Holding the glass of cognac I went over
and opened the window The rain had stopped falling
It was colder outside and there was a mist in the trees

Dont throw the cognac out the window Rinaldi
said If you cant drink it give it to me

Go something yourself I said I was glad to see
Rinaldi again He had spent two years teasing me and
I had always liked it We understood each other very
well

Are you married he asked from the bed I was
standing against the wall by the window

Not yet

Are you in love

Yes

With that English girl

Yes

Poor baby Is she good to you

Of course

I mean is she good to you practically speaking

Shut up




I will You will see I am a man of extreme deli
cacy Does she 

Rinin I said Please shut up If you want to
be my friend shut up

I dont want to be your friend baby I am your
friend

Then shut up

All right

I went over to the bed and sat down beside Rinaldi
He was holding his glass and looking at the floor

You see how it is Rinin

Oh yes All my life I encounter sacred subjects
But very few with you I suppose you must have them
too He looked at the floor

You havent any

No

Not any

No

I can say this about your mother and that about
your sister

And that about your sister Rinaldi said swiftly
We both laughed

The old superman I said

I am jealous maybe Rinaldi said

No youre not

I dont mean like that I mean something else
Have you any married friends

Yes I said

I havent Rinaldi said Not if they love each
other

Why not

They dont like me

Why not




I am the snake I am the snake of reason

Youre getting it mixed The apple was reason

No it was the snake He was more cheerful

You are better when you dont think so deeply I
said

I love you baby he said You puncture me when
I become a great Italian thinker But I know many
things I cant say I know more than you

Yes You do

But you will have a better time Even with re
morse you will have a better time

I dont think so

Oh yes That is true Already I am only happy
when I am working He looked at the floor again

Youll get over that

No I only like two other things one is bad for
my work and the other is over in half an hour or
fifteen minutes Sometimes less

Sometimes a good deal less

Perhaps I have improved baby You do not know
But there are only the two things and my work

Youll get other things

No We never get anything We are born with all
we have and we never learn We never get anything
new We all start complete You should be glad not
to be a Latin

Theres no such thing as a Latin That is Latin
thinking You are so proud of your defects Rinaldi
looked up and laughed

Well stop baby I am tired from thinking so
much He had looked tired when he came in Its
nearly time to eat Im glad youre back You are my
best friend and my war brother

When do the war brothers eat I asked




Right away Well drink once more for your livers
sake

Like Saint Paul

You are inaccurate That was wine and the stom
ach Take a little wine for your stomachs sake

Whatever you have in the bottle I said For
any sake you mention

To your girl Rinaldi said He held out his glass

All right

Ill never say a dirty thing about her

Dont strain yourself

He drank off the cognac I am pure he said
I am like you baby I will get an English girl too
As a matter of fact I knew your girl first but she was
a little tall for me A tall girl for a sister he quoted

You have a lovely pure mind I said

Havent I  Thats why they call me Rinaldo Puris
simo

Rinaldo Sporchissimo

Come on baby well go down to eat while my mind
is still pure

I washed combed my hair and we went down the
stairs Rinaldi was a little drunk In the room where
we ate the meal was not quite ready

Ill go get the bottle Rinaldi said He went off
up the stairs I sat at the table and he came back with
the bottle and poured us each a half tumbler of cognac

Too much I said and held up the glass and sighted
at the lamp on the table

Not for an empty stomach It is a wonderful thing
It burns out the stomach completely Nothing is worse
for you

All right




Selfdestruction day by day Rinaldi said It
ruins the stomach and makes the hand shake Just the
thing for a surgeon

You recommend it

Heartily I use no other Drink it down baby and
look forward to being sick

I drank half the glass In the hall I could hear the
orderly calling Soup Soup is ready

The major came in nodded to us and sat down He
seemed very small at table

Is this all we are he asked The orderly put the
soup bowl down and he ladled out a plate full

We are all Rinaldi said Unless the priest
comes If he knew Federico was here he would be
here

Where is he I asked

Hes at 307 the major said He was busy with
his soup He wiped his mouth wiping his upturned
gray mustache carefully He will come I think I
called them and left word to tell him you were here

I miss the noise of the mess I said

Yes its quiet the major said

I will be noisy said Rinaldi

Drink some wine Enrico said the major He
filled my glass The spaghetti came in and we were all
busy We were finishing the spaghetti when the priest
came in He was the same as ever small and brown
and compact looking I stood up and we shook hands
He put his hand on my shoulder

I came as soon as I heard he said

Sit down the major said Youre late

Goodevening priest Rinaldi said using the Eng
lish word They had taken that up from the priestbait
ing captain who spoke a little English Goodevening



i8 4 A FAREWELL TO ARMS

Rinaldo the priest said The orderly brought him
soup but he said he would start with the spaghetti

How are you he asked me

Fine I said How have things been

Drink some wine priest Rinaldi said Take a lit
tle wine for your stomachs sake Thats Saint Paul
you know

Yes I know said the priest politely Rinaldi filled
his glass

That Saint Paul said Rinaldi Hes the one who
makes all the trouble The priest looked at me and
smiled I could see that the baiting did not touch him
now

That Saint Paul Rinaldi said He was a rounder
and a chaser and then when he was no longer hot he
said it was no good When he was finished he made
the rules for us who are still hot Isnt it true Fede
rico

The major smiled We were eating meat stew now

I never discuss a Saint after dark I said The
priest looked up from the stew and smiled at me

There he is gone over with the priest Rinaldi
said Where are all the good old priestbaiters
Where is Cavalcanti Where is Brundi Where is
Cesare Do I have to bait this priest alone without
support

He is a good priest said the major

He is a good priest said Rinaldi But still a
priest I try to make the mess like the old days I want
to make Federico happy To hell with you priest

I saw the major look at him and notice that he was
drunk His thin face was white The line of his hair
was very black against the white of his forehead




Its all right Rinaldo said the priest Its all
right

To hell with you said Rinaldi To hell with the
whole damn business He sat back in his chair

Hes been under a strain and hes tired the major
said to me He finished his meat and wiped up the
gravy with a piece of bread

I dont give a damn Rinaldi said to the table To
hell with the whole business He looked defiantly
around the table his eyes flat his face pale

All right I said To hell with the whole damn
business

No no said Rinaldi You cant do it You cant
do it I say you cant do it Youre dry and youre
empty and theres nothing else Theres nothing else I
tell you Not a damned thing I know when I stop
working

The priest shook his head The orderly took away
the stew dish

What are you eating meat for Rinaldi turned
to the priest Don you know its Friday

Its Thursday the priest said

Its a lie Its Friday Youre eating the body of
our Lord Its Godmeat I know Its dead Austrian
Thats what youre eating

The white meat is from officers I said completing
the old joke

Rinaldi laughed He filled his glass

Dont mind me he said Im just a little crazy

You ought to have a leave the priest said

The major shook his head at him Rinaldi looked at
the priest

You think I ought to have a leave




The major shook his head at the priest Rinaldi was
looking at the priest

Just as you like the priest said Not if you dont
want

To hell with you Rinaldi said They try to get
rid of me Every night they try to get rid of me I
fight them off What if I have it Everybody has it
The whole worlds got it First he went on assum
ing the manner of a lecturer its a little pimple Then
we notice a rash between the shoulders Then we notice
nothing at all We put our faith in mercury

Or salvarsan the major interrupted quietly

A mercurial product Rinaldi said He acted very
elated now I know something worth two of that
Good old priest he said Youll never get it Baby
will get it Its an industrial accident Its a simple
industrial accident

The orderly brought in the sweet and coffee The
dessert was a sort of black bread pudding with hard
sauce The lamp was smoking  the black smoke going
close up inside the chimney

Bring two candles and take away the lamp the
major said The orderly brought two lighted candles
each in a saucer and took out the lamp blowing it out
Rinaldi was quiet now He seemed all right We
talked and after the coffee we all went out into the hall

You want to talk to the priest I have to go in the
town Rinaldi said Goodnight priest

Goodnight Rinaldo the priest said

Ill see you Fredi Rinaldi said

Yes I said Come in early He made a face and
went out the door The major was standing with us
Hes very tired and overworked he said He thinks
too he has syphilis I dont believe it but he may have




He is treating himself for it Goodnight You will
leave before daylight Enrico 

Yes

Goodby then he said Good luck Peduzzi will
wake you and go with you

Goodby Signor Maggiore

Goodby They talk about an Austrian offensive
but I dont believe it I hope not But anyway it wont
be here Gino will tell you everything The telephone
works well now

Til call regularly

Please do Goodnight Dont let Rinaldi drink so
much brandy

Ill try not to

Goodnight priest

Goodnight Signor Maggiore

He went off into his office



CHAPTER XXVI

I went to the door and looked out It had stopped
raining but there was a mist

Should we go upstairs  I asked the priest

I can only stay a little while

Come on up

We climbed the stairs and went into my room I lay
down on Rinaldis bed The priest sat on my cot that
the orderly had set up It was dark in the room

Well he said how are you really

Im all right Im tired tonight

Im tired too but from no cause

What about the war

I think it will be over soon I dont know why but
I feel it

How do you feel it

You know how your major is Gentle Many
people are like that now

I feel that way myself I said

It has been a terrible summer said the priest He
was surer of himself now than when I had gone away
You cannot believe how it has been Except that you
have been there and you know how it can be Many
people have realized the war this summer Officers
whom I thought could never realize it realize it now

What will happen I stroked the blanket with my
hand

I do not know but I do not think it can go on much
longer

What will happen

They will stop fighting




Who

Both sides

I hope so I said

You dont believe it

I dont believe both sides will stop fighting at once

I suppose not It is too much to expect But when
I see the changes in men I do not think it can go on

Who won the fighting this summer

No one

The Austrians won I said They kept them from
taking San Gabriele Theyve won They wont stop
fighting

If they feel as we feel they may stop They have
gone through the same thing

No one ever stopped when they were winning

You discourage me

I can only say what I think

Then you think it will go on and on Nothing will
ever happen

I dont know I only think the Austrians will not
stop when they have won a victory It is in defeat that
we become Christian

The Austrians are Christians  except for the Bos
nians

I dont mean technically Christian I mean like Our
Lord

He said nothing

We are all gentler now because we are beaten
How would Our Lord have been if Peter had rescued
him in the Garden

He would have been just the same

I dont think so I said

You discourage me he said I believe and I pray
that something will happen I have felt it very close




Something may happen I said But it will hap
pen only to us If they felt the way we do it would be
all right But they have beaten us They feel another
way

Many of the soldiers have always felt this way It
is not because they were beaten

They were beaten to start with They were beaten
when they took them from their farms and put them
in the army That is why the peasant has wisdom be
cause he is defeated from the start Put him in power
and see how wise he is

He did not say anything He was thinking

Now I am depressed myself I said Thats why
I never think about these things I never think and
yet when I begin to talk I say the things I have found
out in my mind without thinking

I had hoped for something

Defeat

No Something more

There isnt anything more Except victory It may
be worse

I hoped for a long time for victory

Me too

Now I dont know

It has to be one or the other

I dont believe in victory any more

I dont But I dont believe in defeat Though it
may be better

What do you believe in 

In sleep I said He stood up

I am very sorry to have stayed so long But I like
so to talk with you

It is very nice to talk again I said that about sleep
ing meaning nothing




We stood up and shook hands in the dark

I sleep at 307 now he said

I go out on post early tomorrow

Til see you when you come back

Well have a walk and talk together I walked
with him to the door

Dont go down he said It is very nice that you
are back Though not so nice for you He put his
hand on my shoulder

Its all right for me I said Goodnight

Goodnight Ciaou 

Ciaou  I said I was deadly sleepy




CHAPTER XXVII

I woke when Rinaldi came in but he did not talk
and I went back to sleep again In the morning I was
dressed and gone before it was light Rinaldi did not
wake when I left

I had not seen the Bainsizza before and it was strange
to go up the slope where the Austrians had been be
yond the place on the river where I had been wounded
There was a steep new road and many trucks Beyond
the road flattened out and I saw woods and steep hills
in the mist There were woods that had been taken
quickly and not smashed Then beyond where the road
was not protected by the hills it was screened by mat
ting on the sides and over the top The road ended in
a wrecked village The lines were up beyond There
was much artillery around The houses were badly
smashed but things were very well organized and there
were signboards everywhere We found Gino and he
got us some coffee and later I went with him and met
various people and saw the posts Gino said the Brit
ish cars were working further down the Bainsizza at
Ravne He had great admiration for the British There
was still a certain amount of shelling he said but not
many wounded There would be many sick now the
rains had started The Austrians were supposed to at
tack but he did not believe it We were supposed to at
tack too but they had not brought up any new troops
so he thought that was off too Food was scarce and
he would be glad to get a full meal in Gorizia What
kind of supper had I had I told him and he said that





would be wonderful He was especially impressed by
the dolce I did not describe it in detail only said it
was a dolce and I think he believed it was something
more elaborate than bread pudding

Did I know where he was going to go I said I
didnt but that some of the other cars were at Capo
retto He hoped he would go up that way It was a
nice little place and he liked the high mountain hauling
up beyond He was a nice boy and every one seemed
to like him He said where it really had been hell was
at San Gabriele and the attack beyond Lorn that had
gone bad He said the Austrians had a great amount
of artillery in the woods along Ternova ridge beyond
and above us and shelled the roads badly at night
There was a battery of naval guns that had gotten on
his nerves I would recognize them because of their
flat trajectory You heard the report and then the
shriek commenced almost instantly They usually fired
two guns at once one right after the other and the
fragments from the burst were enormous He showed
me one a smoothly jagged piece of metal over a foot
long It looked like babbiting metal

I dont suppose they are so effective Gino said
But they scare me They all sound as though they
came directly for you There is the boom then in
stantly the shriek and burst Whats the use of not be
ing wounded if they scare you to death

He said there were Croats in the lines opposite us
now and some Magyars Our troops were still in the
attacking positions There was no wire to speak of and
no place to fall back to if there should be an Austrian
attack There were fine positions for defense along the
low mountains that came up out of the plateau but
nothing had been done about organizing them for de




fense What did I think about the Bainsizza anyway

I had expected it to be flatter more like a plateau
I had not realized it was so broken up

Alto piano Gino said but no piano

We went back to the cellar of the house where he
lived I said I thought a ridge that flattened out on
top and had a little depth would be easier and more
practical to hold than a succession of small mountains
It was no harder to attack up a mountain than on the
level I argued That depends on the mountains he
said Look at San Gabriele

Yes I said but where they had trouble was at
the top where it was flat They got up to the top easy
enough

Not so easy he said

Yes I said but that was a special case because
it was a fortress rather than a mountain anyway The
Austrians had been fortifying it for years I meant
tactically speaking in a war where there was some
movement a succession of mountains were nothing to
hold as a line because it was too easy to turn them
You should have possible mobility and a mountain is
not very mobile Also people always overshoot down
hill If the flank were turned the best men would be
left on the highest mountains I did not believe in a
war in mountains I had thought about it a lot I said
You pinched off one mountain and they pinched off an
other but when something really started every one had
to get down off the mountains

What were you going to do if you had a mountain
frontier he asked

I had not worked that out yet I said and we both
laughed But I said in the old days the Austrians
were always whipped in the quadrilateral around Ve




rona They let them come down onto the plain and
whipped them there 

Yes said Gino But those were Frenchmen and
you can work out military problems clearly when you
are fighting in somebody elses country

Yes I agreed when it is your own country you
cannot use it so scientifically

The Russians did to trap Napoleon

Yes but they had plenty of country If you tried
to retreat to trap Napoleon in Italy you would find
yourself in Brindisi

A terrible place said Gino Have you ever been
there

Not to stay

I am a patriot Gino said But I cannot love
Brindisi or Taranto

Do you love the Bainsizza I asked

The soil is sacred he said But I wish it grew
more potatoes You know when we came here we
found fields of potatoes the Austrians had planted

Has the food really been short

I myself have never had enough to eat but I am a
big eater and I have not starved The mess is average
The regiments in the line get pretty good food but those
in support dont get so much Something is wrong
somewhere There should be plenty of food

The dogfish are selling it somewhere else

Yes they give the battalions in the front line as
much as they can but the ones in back are very short
They have eaten all the Austrians potatoes and chest
nuts from the woods They ought to feed them better
We are big eaters I am sure there is plenty of food
It is very bad for the soldiers to be short of food




Have you ever noticed the difference it makes in the
way you think 

Yes I said It cant win a war but it can lose
one

We wont talk about losing There is enough talk
about losing What has been done this summer cannot
have been done in vain

I did not say anything I was always embarrassed
by the words sacred glorious and sacrifice and the ex
pression in vain We had heard them sometimes stand
ing in the rain almost out of earshot so that only the
shouted words came through and had read them on
proclamations that were slapped up by billposters over
other proclamations now for a long time and I had
seen nothing sacred and the things that were glorious
had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stock
yards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat
except to bury it There were many words that you
could not stand to hear and finally only the names of
places had dignity Certain numbers were the same
way and certain dates and these with the names of the
places were all you could say and have them mean any
thing Abstract words such as glory honor courage
or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of
villages the numbers of roads the names of rivers the
numbers of regiments and the dates Gino was a pa
triot so he said things that separated us sometimes
but he was also a fine boy and I understood his being a
patriot He was born one He left with Peduzzi in the
car to go back to Gorizia

It stormed all that day The wind drove down the
rain and everywhere there was standing water and
mud The plaster of the broken houses was gray and
wet Late in the afternoon the rain stopped and from




out number two post I saw the bare wet autumn coun
try with clouds over the tops of the hills and the straw
screening over the roads wet and dripping The sun
came out once before it went down and shone on the
bare woods beyond the ridge There were many Aus
trian guns in the woods on that ridge but only a few
fired I watched the sudden round puffs of shrapnel
smoke in the sky above a broken farmhouse near where
the line was  soft puffs with a yellow white flash in the
centre You saw the flash then heard the crack then
saw the smoke ball distort and thin in the wind There
were many iron shrapnel balls in the rubble of the
houses and on the road beside the broken house where
the post was but they did not shell near the post that
afternoon We loaded two cars and drove down the
road that was screened with wet mats and the last of
the sun came through in the breaks between the strips
of mattings Before we were out on the clear road be
hind the hill the sun was down We went on down the
clear road and as it turned a corner into the open and
went into the square arched tunnel of matting the rain
started again

The wind rose in the night and at three oclock in the
morning with the rain coming in sheets there was a
bombardment and the Croatians came over across the
mountain meadows and through patches of woods and
into the front line They fought in the dark in the rain
and a counterattack of scared men from the second
line drove them back There was much shelling and
many rockets in the rain and machinegun and rifle
fire all along the line They did not come again and it
was quieter and between the gusts of wind and rain
we could hear the sound of a great bombardment far
to the north




The wounded were coming into the post some were
carried on stretchers some walking and some were
brought on the backs of men that came across the field
They were wet to the skin and all were scared We
filled two cars with stretcher cases as they came up from
the cellar of the post and as I shut the door of the sec
ond car and fastened it I felt the rain on my face turn
to snow The flakes were coming heavy and fast in the
rain

When daylight came the storm was still blowing but
the snow had stopped It had melted as it fell on the
wet ground and now it was raining again There was
another attack just after daylight but it was unsuccess
ful We expected an attack all day but it did not come
until the sun was going down The bombardment
started to the south below the long wooded ridge where
the Austrian guns were concentrated We expected a
bombardment but it did not come It was getting dark
Guns were firing from the field behind the village and
the shells going away had a comfortable sound

We heard that the attack to the south had been un
successful They did not attack that night but we heard
that they had broken through to the north In the night
word came that we were to prepare to retreat The cap
tain at the post told me this He had it from the Bri
gade A little while later he came from the telephone
and said it was a lie The Brigade had received orders
that the line of the Bainsizza should be held no matter
what happened I asked about the break through and
he said that he had heard at the Brigade that the Aus
trians had broken through the twentyseventh army
corps up toward Caporetto There had been a great
battle in the north all day

If those bastards let them through we are cooked
he said




Its Germans that are attacking one of the medi
cal officers said The word Germans was something
to be frightened of We did not want to have any
thing to do with the Germans

There are fifteen divisions of Germans the medi
cal officer said They have broken through and we will
be cut off

At the Brigade they say this line is to be held They
say they have not broken through badly and that we
will hold a line across the mountains from Monte Mag
giore

Where do they hear this

From the Division

The word that we were to retreat came from the
Division

We work under the Army Corps I said But
here I work under you Naturally when you tell me to
go I will go But get the orders straight

The orders are that we stay here You clear the
wounded from here to the clearing station

Sometimes we clear from the clearing station to
the field hospitals too I said Tell me I have never
seen a retreat  if there is a retreat how are all the
wounded evacuated

They are not They take as many as they can and
leave the rest

What will I take in the cars

Hospital equipment

All right I said

The next night the retreat started We heard that
Germans and Austrians had broken through in the
north and were coming down the mountain valleys to
ward Cividale and Udine The retreat was orderly
wet and sullen In the night going slowly along the
crowded roads we passed troops marching under the




rain guns horses pulling wagons mules motor trucks
all moving away from the front There was no more
disorder than in an advance

That night we helped empty the field hospitals that
had been set up in the least ruined villages of the pla
teau taking the wounded down to Plava on the river
bed and the next day hauled all day in the rain to
evacuate the hospitals and clearing station at Plava
It rained steadily and the army of the Bainsizza moved
down off the plateau in the October rain and across the
river where the great victories had commenced in the
spring of that year We came into Gorizia in the mid
dle of the next day The rain had stopped and the town
was nearly empty As we came up the street they were
loading the girls from the soldiers whorehouse into a
truck There were seven girls and they had on their
hats and coats and carried small suitcases Two of
them were crying Of the others one smiled at us and
put out her tongue and fluttered it up and down She
had thick full lips and black eyes

I stopped the car and went over and spoke to the ma
tron The girls from the officers house had left early
that morning she said Where were they going To
Conegliano she said The truck started The girl with
thick lips put out her tongue again at us The matron
waved The two girls kept on crying The others
looked interestedly out at the town I got back in the
car

We ought to go with them Bonello said That
would be a good trip

Well have a good trip I said

Well have a hell of a trip

Thats what I mean I said We came up the drive
to the villa




Id like to be there when some of those tough ba
bies climb in and try and hop them 

You think they will

Sure Everybody in the Second Army knows that
matron

We were outside the villa

They call her the Mother Superior Bonello said
The girls are new but everybody knows her They
must have brought them up just before the retreat

Theyll have a time

Ill say theyll have a time Id like to have a crack
at them for nothing They charge too much at that
house anyway The government gyps us

Take the car out and have the mechanics go over
it I said Change the oil and check the differential
Fill it up and then get some sleep

Yes Signor Tenente

The villa was empty Rinaldi was gone with the
hospital The major was gone taking hospital person
nel in the staff car There was a note on the window
for me to fill the cars with the material piled in the hall
and to proceed to Pordenone The mechanics were
gone already I went out back to the garage The
other two cars came in while I was there and their driv
ers got down It was starting to rain again

Im so sleepy I went to sleep three times com
ing here from Plava Piani said What are we going
to do Tenente

Well change the oil grease them fill them up then
take them around in front and load up the junk theyve
left

Then do we start

No well sleep for three hours




Christ Im glad to sleep Bonello said I couldnt
keep awake driving

Hows your car Aymo  I asked

Its all right

Get me a monkey suit and Ill help you with the
oil

Dont you do that Tenente Aymo said Its
nothing to do You go and pack your things

My things are all packed I said Ill go and
carry out the stuff that they left for us Bring the
cars around as soon as theyre ready

They brought the cars around to the front of the
villa and we loaded them with the hospital equipment
which was piled in the hallway When it was all in
the three cars stood in line down the driveway under the
trees in the rain We went inside

Make a fire in the kitchen and dry your things I
said

I dont care about dry clothes Piani said I want
to sleep

Im going to sleep on the majors bed Bonello
said Im going to sleep where the old man corks off

I dont care where I sleep Piani said

There are two beds in here I opened the door

I never knew what was in that room Bonello said

That was old fishfaces room Piani said

You two sleep in there I said Ill wake you

The Austrians will wake us if you sleep too long
Tenente Bonello said

I wont oversleep I said Wheres Aymo

He went out in the kitchen

Get to sleep I said

Ill sleep Piani said Ive been asleep sitting up




all day The whole top of my head kept coming down
over my eyes

Take your boots off Bonello said Thats old
fishfaces bed

Fishface is nothing to me Piani lay on the bed
his muddy boots straight out his head on his arm I
went out to the kitchen Aymo had a fire in the stove
and a kettle of water on

I thought Id start some pasta asciutta he said
Well be hungry when we wake up

Arent you sleepy Bartolomeo

Not so sleepy When the water boils Ill leave it
The fire will go down

Youd better get some sleep I said We can eat
cheese and monkey meat

This is better he said Something hot will be
good for those two anarchists You go to sleep Ten
ente

Theres a bed in the majors room

You sleep there

No Im going up to my old room Do you want
a drink Bartolomeo

When we go Tenente Now it wouldnt do me any
good

If you wake in three hours and I havent called you
wake me will you

I havent any watch Tenente

Theres a clock on the wall in the majors room

All right

I went out then through the diningroom and the
hall and up the marble stairs to the room where I had
lived with Rinaldi It was raining outside I went
to the window and looked out It was getting dark and
I saw the three cars standing in line under the trees




The trees were dripping in the rain It was cold and
the drops hung to the branches I went back to Ri
naldis bed and lay down and let sleep take me

We ate in the kitchen before we started Aymo had
a basin of spaghetti with onions and tinned meat
chopped up in it We sat around the table and drank
two bottles of the wine that had been left in the cellar
of the villa It was dark outside and still raining
Piani sat at the table very sleepy

I like a retreat better than an advance Bonello
said On a retreat we drink barbera

We drink it now Tomorrow maybe we drink rain
water Aymo said

Tomorrow well be in Udine Well drink cham
pagne Thats where the slackers live Wake up Piani 
Well drink champagne tomorrow in Udine 

Im awake Piani said He filled his plate with the
spaghetti and meat Couldnt you find tomato sauce
Barto

There wasnt any Aymo said

Well drink champagne in Udine Bonello said
He filled his glass with the clear red barbera

We may drink before Udine Piani said

Have you eaten enough Tenente Aymo asked

Ive got plenty Give me the bottle Bartolomeo

I have a bottle apiece to take in the cars Aymo
said

Did you sleep at all 

I dont need much sleep I slept a little

Tomorrow well sleep in the kings bed Bonello
said He was feeling very good

Tomorrow maybe well sleep in  Piani said

Ill sleep with the queen Bonello said He looked
to see how I took the joke




Youll sleep with  Piani said sleepily

Thats treason Tenente  Bonello said Isnt that
treason

Shut up I said You get too funny with a little
wine Outside it was raining hard I looked at my
watch It was half past nine

Its time to roll I said and stood up

Who are you going to ride with Tenente Bo
nello asked

With Aymo Then you come Then Piani Well
start out on the road for Cormons

Im afraid Ill go to sleep Piani said

All right Ill ride with you Then Bonello Then
Aymo

Thats the best way Piani said Because Im so
sleepy

Ill drive and you sleep awhile

No I can drive just so long as I know somebody
will wake me up if I go to sleep

Ill wake you up Put out the lights Barto

You might as well leave them Bonello said
Weve got no more use for this place

I have a small locker trunk in my room I said
Will you help take it down Piani 

Well take it Piani said Come on Aldo He
went off into the hall with Bonello I heard them go
ing upstairs

This was a fine place Bartolomeo Aymo said He
put two bottles of wine and half a cheese into his haver
sack There wont be a place like this again Where
will they retreat to Tenente

Beyond the Tagliamento they say The hospital and
the sector are to be at Pordenone




This is a better town than Pordenone
I dont know Pordenone I said Ive just been
through there

Its not much of a place Aymo said



CHAPTER XXVIII

As we moved out through the town it was empty in
the rain and the dark except for columns of troops and
guns that were going through the main street There
were many trucks too and some carts going through on
other streets and converging on the main road When
we were out past the tanneries onto the main road the
troops the motor trucks the horsedrawn carts and the
guns were in one wide slowmoving column We moved
slowly but steadily in the rain the radiator cap of our
car almost against the tailboard of a truck that was
loaded high the load covered with wet canvas Then
the truck stopped The whole column was stopped It
started again and we went a little farther then stopped
I got out and walked ahead going between the trucks
and carts and under the wet necks of the horses The
block was farther ahead I left the road crossed the
ditch on a footboard and walked along the field beyond
the ditch I could see the stalled column between the
trees in the rain as I went forward across from it in
the field I went about a mile The column did not
move although on the other side beyond the stalled
vehicles I could see the troops moving I went back
to the cars This block might extend as far as Udine
Piani was asleep over the wheel I climbed up beside
him and went to sleep too Several hours later I heard
the truck ahead of us grinding into gear I woke Piani
and we started moving a few yards then stopping
then going on again It was still raining

The column stalled again in the night and did not




start I got down and went back to see Aymo and
Bonello Bonello had two sergeants of engineers on
the seat of his car with him They stiffened when I
came up

They were left to do something to a bridge Bo
nello said They cant find their unit so I gave them a
ride

With the Sir Lieutenants permission

With permission I said

The lieutenant is an American Bonello said
Hell give anybody a ride

One of the sergeants smiled The other asked Bo
nello if I was an Italian from North or South America

Hes not an Italian Hes North American Eng
lish

The sergeants were polite but did not believe it I
left them and went back to Aymo He had two girls
on the seat with him and was sitting back in the corner
and smoking

Barto Barto I said He laughed

Talk to them Tenente he said I cant understand
them Hey he put his hand on the girls thigh and
squeezed it in a friendly way The girl drew her shawl
tight around her and pushed his hand away Hey
he said Tell the Tenente your name and what youre
doing here

The girl looked at me fiercely The other girl kept
her eyes down The girl who looked at me said some
thing in a dialect I could not understand a word of
She was plump and dark and looked about sixteen

Sorella I asked and pointed at the other girl

She nodded her head and smiled

All right I said and patted her knee I felt her
stiffen away when I touched her The sister never




looked up She looked perhaps a year younger Aymo
put his hand on the elder girls thigh and she pushed it
away He laughed at her

Good man he pointed at himself Good man
he pointed at me Dont you worry The girl looked
at him fiercely The pair of them were like two wild
birds

What does she ride with me for if she doesnt like
me Aymo asked They got right up in the car the
minute I motioned to them He turned to the girl

Dont worry he said No danger of  using

the vulgar word No place for  I could see she

understood the word and that was all Her eyes looked
at him very scared She pulled the shawl tight Car

all full Aymo said No danger of  No place

for  Every time he said the word the girl stif
fened a little Then sitting stiffly and looking at him
she began to cry I saw her lips working and then
tears came down her plump cheeks Her sister not
looking up took her hand and they sat there together
The older one who had been so fierce began to sob

I guess I scared her Aymo said I didnt mean
to scare her

Bartolomeo brought out his knapsack and cut off
two pieces of cheese Here he said Stop crying

The older girl shook her head and still cried but the
younger girl took the cheese and commenced to eat
After a while the younger girl gave her sister the sec
ond piece of cheese and they both ate The older sister
still sobbed a little

Shell be all right after a while Aymo said

An idea came to him Virgin he asked the girl
next to him She nodded her head vigorously Vir
gin too  he pointed to the sister Both the girls nod




ded their heads and the elder said something in dialect

Thats all right Bartolomeo said Thats all
right

Both the girls seemed cheered

I left them sitting together with Aymo sitting back
in the corner and went back to Pianis car The column
of vehicles did not move but the troops kept passing
alongside It was still raining hard and I thought some
of the stops in the movement of the column might be
from cars with wet wiring More likely they were
from horses or men going to sleep Still traffic could
tie up in cities when every one was awake It was the
combination of horse and motor vehicles They did not
help each other any The peasants carts did not help
much either Those were a couple of fine girls with
Barto A retreat was no place for two virgins Real
virgins Probably very religious If there were no
war we would probably all be in bed In bed I lay me
down my head Bed and board Stiff as a board in
bed Catherine was in bed now between two sheets
over her and under her Which side did she sleep on
Maybe she wasnt asleep Maybe she was lying think
ing about me Blow blow ye western wind Well it
blew and it wasnt the small rain but the big rain down
that rained It rained all night You knew it rained
down that rained Look at it Christ that my love were
in my arms and I in my bed again That my love Cath
erine That my sweet love Catherine down might rain
Blow her again to me Well we were in it Every one
was caught in it and the small rain would not quiet it
Goodnight Catherine I said out loud I hope you
sleep well If its too uncomfortable darling lie on the
other side I said Ill get you some cold water In a
little while it will be morning and then it wont be so




bad Im sorry he makes you so uncomfortable Try
and go to sleep sweet

I was asleep all the time she said Youve been talk
ing in your sleep Are you all right 

Are you really there 

Of course Im here I wouldnt go way This
doesnt make any difference between us

Youre so lovely and sweet You wouldnt go away
in the night would you 

Of course I wouldnt go away Im always here I
come whenever you want me

  Piani said Theyve started again

I was dopey I said I looked at my watch It
was three oclock in the morning I reached back be
hind the seat for a bottle of the barbera

You talked out loud Piani said

I was having a dream in English I said

The rain was slacking and we were moving along
Before daylight we were stalled again and when it was
light we were at a little rise in the ground and I saw the
road of the retreat stretched out far ahead everything
stationary except for the infantry filtering through We
started to move again but seeing the rate of progress in
the daylight I knew we were going to have to get off
that main road some way and go across country if we
ever hoped to reach Udine

In the night many peasants had joined the column
from the roads of the country and in the column there
were carts loaded with household goods there were
mirrors projecting up between mattresses and chickens
and ducks tied to carts There was a sewingmachine
on the cart ahead of us in the rain They had saved
the most valuable things On some carts the women sat




huddled from the rain and others walked beside the
carts keeping as close to them as they could There were
dogs now in the column keeping under the wagons as
they moved along The road was muddy the ditches at
the side were high with water and beyond the trees that
lined the road the fields looked too wet and too soggy
to try to cross I got down from the car and worked
up the road a way looking for a place where I could see
ahead to find a sideroad we could take across country
I knew there were many sideroads but did not want one
that would lead to nothing I could not remember them
because we had always passed them bowling along in
the car on the main road and they all looked much
alike Now I knew we must find one if we hoped to
get through No one knew where the Austrians were
nor how things were going but I was certain that if
the rain should stop and planes come over and get to
work on that column that it would be all over All that
was needed was for a few men to leave their trucks or
a few horses be killed to tie up completely the move
ment on the road

The rain was not falling so heavily now and I
thought it might clear I went ahead along the edge of
the road and when there was a small road that led off
to the north between two fields with a hedge of trees
on both sides I thought that we had better take it and
hurried back to the cars I told Piani to turn off and
went back to tell Bonello and Aymo

If it leads nowhere we can turn around and cut back
in I said

What about these Bonello asked His two ser
geants were beside him on the seat They were un
shaven but still military looking in the early morning

Theyll be good to push I said I went back to




Aymo and told him we were going to try it across
country

What about my virgin family  Aymo asked The
two girls were asleep

They wont be very useful I said You ought to
have some one that could push

They could go back in the car Aymo said
Theres room in the car

All right if you want them I said Pick up some
body with a wide back to push

Bersaglieri Aymo smiled They have the widest
backs They measure them How do you feel Ten
ente

Fine How are you

Fine But very hungry

There ought to be something up that road and we
will stop and eat

Hows your leg Tenente

Fine I said Standing on the step and looking up
ahead I could see Pianis car pulling out onto the little
sideroad and starting up it his car showing through
the hedge of bare branches Bonello turned off and
followed him and then Piani worked his way out and
we followed the two ambulances ahead along the nar
row road between hedges It led to a farmhouse We
found Piani and Bonello stopped in the farmyard The
house was low and long with a trellis with a grapevine
over the door There was a well in the yard and Piani
was getting up water to fill his radiator So much go
ing in low gear had boiled it out The farmhouse was
deserted I looked back down the road the farmhouse
was on a slight elevation above the plain and we could
see over the country and saw the road the hedges the
fields and the line of trees along the main road where




the retreat was passing The two sergeants were look
ing through the house The girls were awake and look
ing at the courtyard the well and the two big ambu
lances in front of the farmhouse with three drivers at
the well One of the sergeants came out with a clock
in his hand

Tut it back I said He looked at me went in the
house and came back without the clock

 Wheres your partner I asked

Hes gone to the latrine He got up on the seat of
the ambulance He was afraid we would leave him

What about breakfast Tenente Bonello asked
We could eat something It wouldnt take very long

Do you think this road going down on the other
side will lead to anything

Sure

All right Lets eat Piani and Bonello went in
the house

Come on Aymo said to the girls He held his
hand to help them down The older sister shook her
hecid They were not going into any deserted house
They looked after us

They are difficult Aymo said We went into the
farmhouse together It was large and dark an aban
doned feeling Bonello and Piani were in the kitchen

Theres not much to eat Piani said Theyve
cleaned it out

Bonello sliced a big white cheese on the heavy kitchen
table

Where was the cheese

In the cellar Piani found wine too and apples

Thats a good breakfast

Piani was taking the wooden cork out of a big wick




ercovered wine jug He tipped it and poured a copper
pan full

It smells all right he said Find some beakers
Barto

The two sergeants came in

Have some cheese sergeants Bonello said

We should go one of the sergeants said eating his
cheese and drinking a cup of wine

Well go Dont worry Bonello said

An army travels on its stomach I said

What asked the sergeant

Its better to eat

Yes But time is precious

I believe the bastards have eaten already Piani
said The sergeants looked at him They hated the lot
of us

You know the road one of them asked me

No I said They looked at each other

We would do best to start the first one said

We are starting I said I drank another cup of
the red wine It tasted very good after the cheese and
apple

Bring the cheese I said and went out Bonello
came out carrying the great jug of wine

Thats too big I said He looked at it regretfully

I guess it is he said Give me the canteens to
fill He filled the canteens and some of the wine ran
out on the stone paving of the courtyard Then he
picked up the wine jug and put it just inside the door

The Austrians can find it without breaking the door
down he said

Well roll I said Piani and I will go ahead
The two engineers were already on the seat beside Bo
nello The girls were eating cheese and apples Aymo




was smoking We started off down the narrow road
I looked back at the two cars coming and the farm
house It was a fine low solid stone house and the
ironwork of the well was very good Ahead of us the
road was narrow and muddy and there was a high
hedge on either side Behind the cars were following
closely



CHAPTER XXIX

At noon we were stuck in a muddy road about as
nearly as we could figure ten kilometres from Udine
The rain had stopped during the forenoon and three
times we had heard planes coming seen them pass over
head watched them go far to the left and heard them
bombing on the main highroad We had worked through
a network of secondary roads and had taken many roads
that were blind but had always by backing up and find
ing another road gotten closer to Udine Now Aymos
car in backing so that we might get out of a blind road
had gotten into the soft earth at the side and the wheels
spinning had dug deeper and deeper until the car rested
on its differential The thing to do now was to dig out
in front of the wheels put in brush so that the chains
could grip and then push until the car was on the road
We were all down on the road around the car The
two sergeants looked at the car and examined the
wheels Then they started off down the road without a
word I went after them

Come on I said Cut some brush

We have to go one said

Get busy I said and cut brush

We have to go one said The other said nothing
They were in a hurry to start They would not look at
me

I order you to come back to the car and cut brush
I said The one sergeant turned We have to go on
In a little while you will be cut off You cant order
us Youre not our officer

I order you to cut brush I said They turned and
started down the road




ai8 A FAREWELL TO ARMS

Halt I said They kept on down the muddy road
the hedge on either side I order you to halt I called
They went a little faster I opened up my holster took
the pistol aimed at the one who had talked the most
and fired I missed and they both started to run I
shot three times and dropped one The other went
through the hedge and was out of sight I fired at him
through the hedge as he ran across the field The pistol
clicked empty and I put in another clip I saw it was
too far to shoot at the second sergeant He was far
across the field running his head held low I com
menced to reload the empty clip Bonello came up

Let me go finish him he said I handed him the
pistol and he walked down to where the sergeant of
engineers lay face down across the road Bonello leaned
over put the pistol against the mans head and pulled
the trigger The pistol did not fire

You have to cock it I said He cocked it and
fired twice He took hold of the sergeants legs and
pulled him to the side of the road so he lay beside the
hedge He came back and handed me the pistol

The son of a bitch he said He looked toward
the sergeant You see me shoot him Tenente

Weve got to get the brush quickly I said Did
I hit the other one at all

I dont think so Aymo said He was too far
away to hit with a pistol

The dirty scum Piani said We were all cutting
twigs and branches Everything had been taken out
of the car Bonello was digging out in front of the
wheels When we were ready Aymo started the car
and put it into gear The wheels spun round throwing
brush and mud Bonello and I pushed until we could
feel our joints crack The car would not move




Rock her back and forth Barto I said

He drove the engine in reverse then forward The
wheels only dug in deeper Then the car was resting
on the differential again and the wheels spun freely in
the holes they had dug I straightened up

Well try her with a rope I said

I dont think its any use Tenente You cant get
a straight pull 

We have to try it I said She wont come out
any other way

Pianis and Bonellos cars could only move straight
ahead down the narrow road We roped both cars to
gether and pulled The wheels only pulled sideways
against the ruts

Its no good I shouted Stop it

Piani and Bonello got down from their cars and
came back Aymo got down The girls were up the road
about forty yards sitting on a stone wall

What do you say Tenente Bonello asked

Well dig out and try once more with the brush
I said I looked down the road It was my fault I
had led them up here The sun was almost out from
behind the clouds and the body of the sergeant lay be
side the hedge

Well put his coat and cape under I said Bonello
went to get them I cut brush and Aymo and Piani
dug out in front and between the wheels I cut the
cape then ripped it in two and laid it under the wheel
in the mud then piled brush for the wheels to catch
We were ready to start and Aymo got up on the seat
and started the car The wheels spun and we pushed
and pushed But it wasnt any use

Its ed I said Is there anything you want

in the ear Barto




Aymo climbed up with Bonello carrying the cheese
and two bottles of wine and his cape Bonello sitting
behind the wheel was looking through the pockets of
the sergeants coat

Better throw the coat away I said What about
Bartos virgins 

They can get in the back Piani said I dont
think we are going far

I opened the back door of the ambulance

Come on I said Get in The two girls climbed
in and sat in the corner They seemed to have taken no
notice of the shooting I looked back up the road The
sergeant lay in his dirty longsleeved underwear I
got up with Piani and we started We were going to
try to cross the field When the road entered the field
I got down and walked ahead If we could get across
there was a road on the other side We could not get
across It was too soft and muddy for the cars When
they were finally and completely stalled the wheels
dug in to the hubs we left them in the field and started
on foot for Udine

When we came to the road which led back toward
the main highway I pointed down it to the two girls

Go down there I said Youll meet people They
looked at me I took out my pocketbook and gave them
each a tenlira note Go down there I said pointing
Friends Family

They did not understand but they held the money
tightly and started down the road They looked back
as though they were afraid I might take the money
back I watched them go down the road their shawls
close around them looking back apprehensively at us
The three drivers were laughing




How much will you give me to go in that direction
Tenente Bonello asked

Theyre better off in a bunch of people than alone
if they catch them I said

Give me two hundred lire and Ill walk straight
back toward Austria Bonello said

Theyd take it away from you Piani said

Maybe the war will be over Aymo said We were
going up the road as fast as we could The sun was
trying to come through Beside the road were mul
berry trees Through the trees I could see our two big
movingvans of cars stuck in the field Piani looked
back too

Theyll have to build a road to get them out he
said

I wish to Christ we had bicycles Bonello said

Do they ride bicycles in America Aymo asked

They used to

Here it is a great thing Aymo said A bicycle is
a splendid thing

I wish to Christ we had bicycles Bonello said Im
no walker

Is that firing I asked I thought I could hear
firing a long way away

I dont know Aymo said He listened

I think so I said

The first thing we will see will be the cavalry
Piani said

I dont think theyve got any cavalry

I hope to Christ not Bonello said I dont want
to be stuck on a lance by any cavalry

You certainly shot that sergeant Tenente Piani
said We were walking fast

I killed him Bonello said I never killed anybody




in this war and all my life Ive wanted to kill a ser
geant

You killed him on the sit all right Piani said
He wasnt flying very fast when you killed him

Never mind Thats one thing I can always remem
ber I killed that of a sergeant

What will you say in confession Aymo asked

Ill say Bless me father I killed a sergeant  They
all laughed

Hes an anarchist Piani said He doesnt go to
church

Pianis an anarchist too Bonello said

Are you really anarchists I asked

No Tenente Were socialists We come from
Imola

Havent you ever been there

No

By Christ its a fine place Tenente You come
there after the war and well show you something

Are you all socialists

Everybody

Is it a fine town

Wonderful You never saw a town like that

How did you get to be socialists

Were all socialists Everybody is a socialist
Weve always been socialists

You come Tenente Well make you a socialist
too

Ahead the road turned off to the left and there was
a little hill and beyond a stone wall an apple orchard
As the road went uphill they ceased talking We walked
along together all going fast against time



CHAPTER XXX

Later we were on a road that led to a river There
was a long line of abandoned trucks and carts on the
road leading up to the bridge No one was in sight
The river was high and the bridge had been blown up
in the centre the stone arch was fallen into the river
and the brown water was going over it We went on
up the bank looking for a place to cross Up ahead I
knew there was a railway bridge and I thought we
might be able to get across there The path was wet
and muddy We did not see any troops only aban
doned trucks and stores Along the river bank there
was nothing and no one but the wet brush and muddy
ground We went up to the bank and finally we saw
the railway bridge

What a beautiful bridge Aymo said It was a
long plain iron bridge across what was usually a dry
riverbed

We better hurry and get across before they blow it
up I said

Theres nobody to blow it up Piani said Theyre
all gone

Its probably mined Bonello said You cross
first Tenente

Listen to the anarchist Aymo said Make him
go first

HI go I said It wont be mined to blow up with
one man

You see Piani said That is brains Why
havent you brains anarchist





If I had brains I wouldnt be here Bonello said

Thats pretty good Tenente Aymo said

Thats pretty good I said We were close to the
bridge now The sky had clouded over again and it
was raining a little The bridge looked long and solid
We climbed up the embankment

Come one at a time I said and started across the
bridge I watched the ties and the rails for any trip
wires or signs of explosive but I saw nothing Down
below the gaps in the ties the river ran muddy and fast
Ahead across the wet countryside I could see Udine in
the rain Across the bridge I looked back Just up the
river was another bridge As I watched a yellow mud
colored motor car crossed it The sides of the bridge
were high and the body of the car once on was out of
sight But I saw the heads of the driver the man on
the seat with him and the two men on the rear seat
They all wore German helmets Then the car was over
the bridge and out of sight behind the trees and the
abandoned vehicles on the road I waved to Aymo
who was crossing and to the others to come on I
climbed down and crouched beside the railway embank
ment Aymo came down with me

Did you see the car I asked

No We were watching you

A German staff car crossed on the upper bridge

A staff car

Yes

Holy Mary

The others came and we all crouched in the mud be
hind the embankment looking across the rails at the
bridge the line of trees the ditch and the road

Do you think were cut off then Tenente

I dont know All I know is a German staff car
went along that road




You dont feel funny Tenente You havent got
strange feelings in the head

Dont be funny Bonello 

What about a drink  Piani asked If were cut
off we might as well have a drink He unhooked his
canteen and uncorked it

Look Look Aymo said and pointed toward the
road Along the top of the stone bridge we could see
German helmets moving They were bent forward and
moved smoothly almost supernaturally along As
they came off the bridge we saw them They were
bicycle troops I saw the faces of the first two They
were ruddy and healthylooking Their helmets came
low down over their foreheads and the side of their
faces Their carbines were clipped to the frame of the
bicycles Stick bombs hung handle down from their
belts Their helmets and their gray uniforms were wet
and they rode easily looking ahead and to both sides
There were two  then four in line then two then al
most a dozen then another dozen  then one alone
They did not talk but we could not have heard them
because of the noise from the river They were gone
out of sight up the road

Holy Mary Aymo said

They were Germans Piani said Those werent
Austrians

Why isnt there somebody here to stop them I
said Why havent they blown the bridge up Why
arent there machineguns along this embankment

You tell us Tenente Bonello said

I was very angry

The whole bloody thing is crazy Down below they
blow up a little bridge Here they leave a bridge on
the main road Where is everybody Dont they try
and stop them at all




You tell us Tenente Bonello said I shut up It
was none of my business  all I had to do was to get to
Pordenone with three ambulances I had failed at that
All I had to do now was get to Pordenone I prob
ably could not even get to Udine The hell I couldnt
The thing to do was to be calm and not get shot or
captured

Didnt you have a canteen open I asked Piani
He handed it to me I took a long drink We might
as well start I said Theres no hurry though Do
you want to eat something

This is no place to stay Bonello said

All right Well start

Should we keep on this side  out of sight

Well be better off on top They may come along
this bridge too We dont want them on top of us
before we see them

We walked along the railroad track On both sides
of us stretched the wet plain Ahead across the plain
was the hill of Udine The roofs fell away from the
castle on the hill We could see the campanile and the
clocktower There were many mulberry trees in the
fields Ahead I saw a place where the rails were torn
up The ties had been dug out too and thrown down
the embankment

Down down Aymo said We dropped down be
side the embankment There was another group of
bicyclists passing along the road I looked over the
edge and saw them go on

They saw us but they went on Aymo said

Well get killed up there Tenente Bonello said

They dont want us I said Theyre after some
thing else Were in more danger if they should come
on us suddenly




Id rather walk here out of sight Bonello said

All right Well walk along the tracks

Do you think we can get through Aymo asked

Sure There arent very many of them yet Well
go through in the dark

What was that staff car doing

Christ knows I said We kept on up the tracks
Bonello tired of walking in the mud of the embank
ment and came up with the rest of us The railway
moved south away from the highway now and we could
not see what passed along the road A short bridge
over a canal was blown up but we climbed across on
what was left of the span We heard firing ahead of
us

We came up on the railway beyond the canal It
went on straight toward the town across the low fields
We could see the line of the other railway ahead of us
To the north was the main road where we had seen the
cyclists to the south there was a small branchroad
across the fields with thick trees on each side I
thought we had better cut to the south and work
around the town that w r ay and across country toward
Campoformio and the main road to the Tagliamento
We could avoid the main line of the retreat by keeping
to the secondary roads beyond Udine I knew there
were plenty of sideroads across the plain I started
down the embankment

Come on I said We would make for the side
road and work to the south of the town We all started
down the embankment A shot was fired at us from the
sideroad The bullet went into the mud of the em
bankment

Go on back I shouted I started up the embank
ment slipping in the mud The drivers were ahead of




me I went up the embankment as fast as I could go
Two more shots came from the thick brush and Aymo
as he was crossing the tracks lurched tripped and fell
face down We pulled him down on the other side and
turned him over His head ought to be uphill I
said Piani moved him around He lay in the mud
on the side of the embankment his feet pointing down
hill breathing blood irregularly The three of us
squatted over him in the rain He was hit low in the
back of the neck and the bullet had ranged upward and
come out under the right eye He died while I was
stopping up the two holes Piani laid his head down
wiped at his face with a piece of the emergency dress
ing then let it alone

The  he said

They werent Germans I said There cant be
any Germans over there

Italians Piani said using the word as an epithet
Italiani Bonello said nothing He was sitting be
side Aymo not looking at him Piani picked up Aymos
cap where it had rolled down the embankment and put
it over his face He took out his canteen

Do you want a drink Piani handed Bonello the
canteen

No Bonello said He turned to me That might
have happened to us any time on the railway tracks

No I said It was because we started across the
field

Bonello shook his head Aymos dead he said
Whos dead next Tenente Where do we go now

Those were Italians that shot I said They
werent Germans

I suppose if they were Germans theyd have killed
all of us Bonello said




We are in more danger from Italians than Ger
mans I said The rear guard are afraid of every
thing The Germans know what theyre after

You reason it out Tenente Bonello said

Where do we go now Piani asked

We better lie up some place till its dark If we
could get south wed be all right

Theyd have to shoot us all to prove they were right
the first time Bonello said Im not going to try
them

Well find a place to lie up as near to Udine as we
can get and then go through when its dark

Lets go then Bonello said We went down the
north side of the embankment I looked back Ay mo
lay in the mud with the angle of the embankment He
was quite small and his arms were by his side his
putteewrapped legs and muddy boots together his cap
over his face He looked very dead It was raining
I had liked him as well as any one I ever knew I had
his papers in my pocket and would write to his family
Ahead across the fields was a farmhouse There were
trees around it and the farm buildings were built
against the house There was a balcony along the sec
ond floor held up by columns

We better keep a little way apart I said Ill go
ahead I started toward the farmhouse There was a
path across the field

Crossing the field I did not know but that some one
would fire on us from the trees near the farmhouse or
from the farmhouse itself I walked toward it seeing
it very clearly The balcony of the second floor merged
into the barn and there was hay coming out between
the columns The courtyard was of stone blocks and
all the trees were dripping with the rain There was a




big empty two wheeled cart the shafts tipped high up
in the rain I came to the courtyard crossed it and
stood under the shelter of the balcony The door of the
house was open and I went in Bonello and Piani came
in after me It was dark inside I went back to the
kitchen There were ashes of a fire on the big open
hearth The pots hung over the ashes but they were
empty I looked around but I could not find anything
to eat

We ought to lie up in the barn I said Do you
think you could find anything to eat Piani and bring
it up there 

Til look Piani said

Til look too Bonello said

All right  I said Til go up and look at the
barn I found a stone stairway that went up from
the stable underneath The stable smelt dry and pleas
ant in the rain The cattle were all gone probably
driven off when they left The barn was half full of
hay There were two windows in the roof one was
blocked with boards the other was a narrow dormer
window on the north side There was a chute so that
hay might be pitched down to the cattle Beams crossed
the opening down into the main floor where the hay
carts drove in when the hay was hauled in to be pitched
up I heard the rain on the roof and smelled the hay
and when I went down the clean smell of dried dung
in the stable We could pry a board loose and see out
of the south window down into the courtyard The
other window looked out on the field toward the north
We could get out of either window onto the roof and
down or go down the hay chute if the stairs were im
practical It was a big barn and we could hide in the
hay if we heard any one It seemed like a good place




I was sure we could have gotten through to the south
if they had not fired on us It was impossible that there
were Germans there They were coming from the north
and down the road from Cividale They could not have
come through from the south The Italians were even
more dangerous They were frightened and firing on
anything they saw Last night on the retreat we had
heard that there had been many Germans in Italian
uniforms mixing with the retreat in the north I did
not believe it That was one of those things you always
heard in the war It was one of the things the enemy
always did to you You did not know any one who
went over in German uniform to confuse them Maybe
they did but it sounded difficult I did not believe the
Germans did it I did not believe they had to There
was no need to confuse our retreat The size of the
army and the fewness of the roads did that Nobody
gave any orders let alone Germans Still they would
shoot us for Germans They shot Aymo The hay
smelled good and lying in a barn in the hay took away
all the years in between We had lain in hay and
talked and shot sparrows with an airrifle when they
perched in the triangle cut high up in the wall of the
barn The barn was gone now and one year they had
cut the hemlock woods and there were only stumps
dried treetops branches and fireweed where the woods
had been You could not go back If you did not go
forward what happened  You never got back to Milan
And if you got back to Milan what happened I
listened to the firing to the north toward Udine I
could hear machinegun firing There was no shelling
That was something They must have gotten some
troops along the road I looked down in the halflight
of the haybarn and saw Piani standing on the hauling




floor He had a long sausage a jar of something and
two bottles of wine under his arm

Come up I said There is the ladder Then I
realized that I should help him with the things and
went down I was vague in the head from lying in the
hay I had been nearly asleep

Wheres Bonello I asked

Ill tell you Piani said We went up the ladder
Up on the hay we set the things down Piani took out
his knife with the corkscrew and drew the cork on a
wine bottle

They have sealingwax on it he said It must be
good He smiled

Wheres Bonello I asked

Piani looked at me

He went away Tenente he said He wanted to
be a prisoner

I did not say anything

He was afraid we would get killed

I held the bottle of wine and did not say anything

You see we dont believe in the war anyway Ten
ente

Why didnt you go I asked

I did not want to leave you

Where did he go

I dont know Tenente He went away

All right I said Will you cut the sausage

Piani looked at me in the halflight

I cut it while we were talking he said We sat
in the hay and ate the sausage and drank the wine It
must have been wine they had saved for a wedding It
was so old that it was losing its color

You look out of this window Luigi I said Ill
go look out the other window




We had each been drinking out of one of the bottles
and I took my bottle with me and went over and lay
flat on the hay and looked out the narrow window at
the wet country I do not know what I expected to
see but I did not see anything except the fields and the
bare mulberry trees and the rain falling I drank the
wine and it did not make me feel good They had kept
it too long and it had gone to pieces and lost its quality
and color I watched it get dark outside  the darkness
came very quickly It would be a black night with the
rain When it was dark there was no use watching any
more so I went over to Piani He was lying asleep and
I did not wake him but sat down beside him for a
while He was a big man and he slept heavily After
a while I woke him and we started

That was a very strange night I do not know what
I had expected death perhaps and shooting in the dark
and running but nothing happened We waited lying
flat beyond the ditch along the main road while a Ger
man battalion passed then when they were gone we
crossed the road and went on to the north We were
very close to Germans twice in the rain but they did
not see us We got past the town to the north without
seeing any Italians then after a while came on the
main channels of the retreat and walked all night
toward the Tagliamento I had not realized how gigan
tic the retreat was The whole country was moving as
well as the army We walked all night making better
time than the vehicles My leg ached and I was tired
but we made good time It seemed so silly for Bonello
to have decided to be taken prisoner There was no
danger We had walked through two armies without
incident If Aymo had not been killed there would
never have seemed to be any danger No one had




bothered us when we were in plain sight along the rail
way The killing came suddenly and unreasonably I
wondered where Bonello was

How do you feel Tenente  Piani asked We were
going along the side of a road crowded with vehicles
and troops

Fine

Im tired of this walking

Well all we have to do is walk now We dont have
to worry

Bonello was a fool

He was a fool all right

What will you do about him Tenente

I dont know

Cant you just put him down as taken prisoner

I dont know

You see if the war went on they would make bad
trouble for his family

The war wont go on a soldier said Were
going home The war is over

Everybodys going home

Were all going home

Come on Tenente Piani said He wanted to get
past them

Tenente Whos a Tenente A basso gli ufficiali
Down with the officers 

Piani took me by the arm I better call you by your
name he said They might try and make trouble
Theyve shot some officers We worked up past them

I wont make a report that will make trouble for his
family I went on with our conversation

If the war is over it makes no difference Piani
said But I dont believe its over Its too good that
it should be over




Well know pretty soon I said

I dont believe its over They all think its over
but I dont believe it

Viva la Pace a soldier shouted out Were go
ing home 

It would be fine if we all went home Piani said
Wouldnt you like to go home

Yes

Well never go I dont think its over

Andiamo a casa a soldier shouted

They throw away their rifles Piani said They
take them off and drop them down while theyre
marching Then they shout

They ought to keep their rifles

They think if they throw away their rifles they
cant make them fight

In the dark and the rain making our way along the
side of the road I could see that many of the troops
still had their rifles They stuck up above the capes

What brigade are you an officer called out

Brigata di Pace some one shouted Peace Bri
gade The officer said nothing

What does he say What does the officer say

Down with the officer Viva la Pace

Come on Piani said We passed two British am
bulances abandoned in the block of vehicles

Theyre from Gorizia Piani said I know the
cars

They got further than we did

They started earlier

I wonder where the drivers are

Up ahead probably

The Germans have stopped outside Udine I said
These people will all get across the river




Yes Piani said Thats why I think the war will
go on

The Germans could come on I said I wonder
why they dont come on

I dont know I dont know anything about this
kind of war

They have to wait for their transport I suppose

I dont know Piani said Alone he was much
gentler When he was with the others he was a very
rough talker

Are you married Luigi

You know I am married

Is that why you did not want to be a prisoner

That is one reason Are you married Tenente

No

Neither is Bonello

You cant tell anything by a mans being married
But I should think a married man would want to get
back to his wife I said I would be glad to talk about
wives

Yes

How are your feet

Theyre sore enough

Before daylight we reached the bank of the Taglia
mento and followed down along the flooded river to the
bridge where all the traffic was crossing

They ought to be able to hold at this river Piani
said In the dark the flood looked high The water
swirled and it was wide The wooden bridge was
nearly threequarters of a mile across and the river
that usually ran in narrow channels in the wide stony
bed far below the bridge was close under the wooden
planking We went along the bank and then worked




our way into the crowd that were crossing the bridge
Crossing slowly in the rain a few feet above the flood
pressed tight in the crowd the box of an artillery caisson
just ahead I looked over the side and watched the
river Now that we could not go our own pace I felt
very tired There was no exhilaration in crossing the
bridge I wondered what it would be like if a plane
bombed it in the daytime

Piani I said

Here I am Tenente He was a little ahead in the
jam No one was talking They were all trying to get
across as soon as they could thinking only of that
We were almost across At the far end of the bridge
there were officers and carabinieri standing on both
sides flashing lights I saw them silhouetted against
the skyline As we came close to them I saw one of
the officers point to a man in the column A carabiniere
went in after him and came out holding the man by the
arm He took him away from the road We came
almost opposite them The officers were scrutinizing
every one in the column sometimes speaking to each
other going forward to flash a light in some ones
face They took some one else out just before we came
opposite I saw the man He was a lieutenantcolo
nel I saw the stars in the box on his sleeve as they
flashed a light on him His hair was gray and he was
short and fat The carabiniere pulled him in behind the
line of officers As we came opposite I saw one or
two of them look at me Then one pointed at me and
spoke to a carabiniere I saw the carabiniere start for
me come through the edge of the column toward me
then felt him take me by the collar

Whats the matter with you I said and hit him in
the face I saw his face under the hat upturned mus




taches and blood coming down his cheek Another
one dove in toward us

 Whats the matter with you I said He did not
answer He was watching a chance to grab me I put
my arm behind me to loosen my pistol

Dont you know you cant touch an officer

The other one grabbed me from behind and pulled
my arm up so that it twisted in the socket I turned
with him and the other one grabbed me around the
neck I kicked his shins and got my left knee into his
groin

Shoot him if he resists I heard some one say

Whats the meaning of this  I tried to shout but
my voice was not very loud They had me at the side
of the road now

Shoot him if he resists an officer said Take him
over back

Who are you

Youll find out

Who are you

Battle police another officer said

Why dont you ask me to step over instead of hav
ing one of these airplanes grab me

They did not answer They did not have to answer
They were battle police

Take him back there with the others the first
officer said You see He speaks Italian with an ac
cent

So do you you  I said

Take him back with the others the first officer
said They took me down behind the line of officers
below the road toward a group of people in a field by
the river bank As we walked toward them shots were
fired I saw flashes of the rifles and heard the reports




We came up to the group There were four officers
standing together with a man in front of them with a
carabiniere on each side of him A group of men were
standing guarded by carabinieri Four other carabin
ieri stood near the questioning officers leaning on their
carbines They were widehatted carabinieri The
two who had me shoved me in with the group waiting
to be questioned I looked at the man the officers were
questioning He was the fat grayhaired little lieuten
antcolonel they had taken out of the column The
questioners had all the efficiency coldness and com
mand of themselves of Italians who are firing and are
not being fired on

Your brigade 

He told them

Regiment

He told them

Why are you not with your regiment

He told them

Do you not know that an officer should be with his
troops

He did

That was all Another officer spoke

It is you and such as you that have let the barba
rians onto the sacred soil of the fatherland

I beg your pardon said the lieutenantcolonel

It is because of treachery such as yours that we
have lost the fruits of victory

Have you ever been in a retreat the lieutenant
colonel asked

Italy should never retreat

We stood there in the rain and listened to this We
were facing the officers and the prisoner stood in front
and a little to one side of us




If you are going to shoot me the lieutenantcolo
nel said please shoot me at once without further
questioning The questioning is stupid He made the
sign of the cross The officers spoke together One
wrote something on a pad of paper

Abandoned his troops ordered to be shot he said

Two carabinieri took the lieutenantcolonel to the
river bank He walked in the rain an old man with
his hat off a carabiniere on either side I did not
watch them shoot him but I heard the shots They
were questioning some one else This officer too was
separated from his troops He was not allowed to make
an explanation He cried when they read the sentence
from the pad of paper and they were questioning an
other when they shot him They made a point of being
intent on questioning the next man while the man who
had been questioned before was being shot In this way
there was obviously nothing they could do about it I
did not know whether I should wait to be questioned or
make a break now I was obviously a German in Italian
uniform I saw how their minds worked if they had
minds and if they worked They were all young men
and they were saving their country The second army
was being reformed beyond the Tagliamento They
were executing officers of the rank of major and above
who were separated from their troops They were also
dealing summarily with German agitators in Italian uni
form They wore steel helmets Only two of us had
steel helmets Some of the carabinieri had them The
other carabinieri wore the wide hat Airplanes we called
them We stood in the rain and were taken out one at
a time to be questioned and shot So far they had shot
every one they had questioned The questioners had
that beautiful detachment and devotion to stern justice




of men dealing in death without being in any danger
of it They were questioning a full colonel of a line
regiment Three more officers had just been put in
with us

 Where was his regiment 

I looked at the carabinieri They were looking at the
newcomers The others were looking at the colonel I
ducked down pushed between two men and ran for
the river my head down I tripped at the edge and
went in with a splash The water was very cold and I
stayed under as long as I could I could feel the cur
rent swirl me and I stayed under until I thought I
could never come up The minute I came up I took a
breath and went down again It was easy to stay
under with so much clothing and my boots When I
came up the second time I saw a piece of timber ahead
of me and reached it and held on with one hand I
kept my head behind it and did not even look over it
I did not want to see the bank There were shots when
I ran and shots when I came up the first time I heard
them when I was almost above water There were no
shots now The piece of timber swung in the current
and I held it with one hand I looked at the bank It
seemed to be going by very fast There was much
wood in the stream The water was very cold We
passed the brush of an island above the water I held
onto the timber with both hands and let it take me
along The shore was out of sight now







CHAPTER XXXI

You do not know how long you are in a river when
the current moves swiftly It seems a long time and it
may be very short The water was cold and in flood
and many things passed that had been floated off the
banks when the river rose I was lucky to have a heavy
timber to hold on to and I lay in the icy water with
my chin on the wood holding as easily as I could with
both hands I was afraid of cramps and I hoped we
would move toward the shore We went down the
river in a long curve It was beginning to be light
enough so I could see the bushes along the shoreline
There was a brush island ahead and the current moved
toward the shore I wondered if I should take off my
boots and clothes and try to swim ashore but decided
not to I had never thought of anything but that I
would reach the shore some way and I would be in a
bad position if I landed barefoot I had to get to Mestre
some way

I watched the shore come close then swing away
then come closer again We were floating more slowly
The shore was very close now I could see twigs on
the willow bush The timber swung slowly so that the
bank was behind me and I knew we were in an eddy
We went slowly around As I saw the bank again very
close now I tried holding with one arm and kicking
and swimming the timber toward the bank with the
other but I did not bring it any closer I was afraid
we would move out of the eddy and holding with one
hand I drew up my feet so they were against the side
of the timber and shoved hard toward the bank I





could see the brush but even with my momentum and
swimming as hard as I could the current was taking me
away I thought then I would drown because of my
boots but I thrashed and fought through the water
and when I looked up the bank was coming toward me
and I kept thrashing and swimming in a heavyfooted
panic until I reached it I hung to the willow branch
and did not have strength to pull myself up but I knew
I would not drown now It had never occurred to me
on the timber that I might drown I felt hollow and
sick in my stomach and chest from the effort and I
held to the branches and waited When the sick feeling
was gone I pulled into the willow bushes and rested
again my arms around some brush holding tight with
my hands to the branches Then I crawled out pushed
on through the willows and onto the bank It was half
daylight and I saw no one I lay flat on the bank and
heard the river and the rain

After a while I got up and started along the bank
I knew there was no bridge across the river until Lati
sana I thought I might be opposite San Vito I be
gan to think out what I should do Ahead there was a
ditch running into the river I went toward it So far
I had seen no one and I sat down by some bushes along
the bank of the ditch and took off my shoes and emp
tied them of water I took off my coat took my wallet
with my papers and my money all wet in it out of the
inside pocket and then wrung the coat out I took off
my trousers and wrung them too then my shirt and
underclothing I slapped and rubbed myself and then
dressed again I had lost my cap

Before I put on my coat I cut the cloth stars off my
sleeves and put them in the inside pocket with my
money My money was wet but was all right I count




ed it There were three thousand and some lire My
clothes felt wet and clammy and I slapped my arms to
keep the circulation going I had woven underwear and
I did not think I would catch cold if I kept moving
They had taken my pistol at the road and I put the
holster under my coat I had no cape and it was cold
in the rain I started up the bank of the canal It was
daylight and the country was wet low and dismal look
ing The fields were bare and wet a long way away
I could see a campanile rising out of the plain I came
up onto a road Ahead I saw some troops coming down
the road I limped along the side of the road and they
passed me and paid no attention to me They were
a machinegun detachment going up toward the river
I went on down the road

That day I crossed the Venetian plain It is a low
level country and under the rain it is even flatter To
ward the sea there are salt marshes and very few roads
The roads all go along the river mouths to the sea and
to cross the country you must go along the paths beside
the canals I was working across the country from the
north to the south and had crossed two railway lines
and many roads and finally I came out at the end of a
path onto a railway line where it ran beside a marsh
It was the main line from Venice to Trieste with a
high solid embankment a solid roadbed and double
track Down the tracks a way was a flagstation and
I could see soldiers on guard Up the line there was a
bridge over a stream that flowed into the marsh I
could see a guard too at the bridge Crossing the fields
to the north I had seen a train pass on this railroad
visible a long way across the flat plain and I thought
a train might come from Portogruaro I watched the
guards and lay down on the embankment so that I




could see both ways along the track The guard at the
bridge walked a way up the line toward where I lay
then turned and went back toward the bridge I lay
and was hungry and waited for the train The one I
had seen was so long that the engine moved it very
slowly and I was sure I could get aboard it After I
had almost given up hoping for one I saw a train com
ing The engine coming straight on grew larger slowly
I looked at the guard at the bridge He was walking
on the near side of the bridge but on the other side of
the tracks That would put him out of sight when the
train passed I watched the engine come nearer It
was working hard I could see there were many cars
I knew there would be guards on the train and I tried
to see where they were but keeping out of sight I
could not The engine was almost to where I was lying
When it came opposite working and puffing even on the
level and I saw the engineer pass I stood up and
stepped up close to the passing cars If the guards
were watching I was a less suspicious object standing
beside the track Several closed freightcars passed
Then I saw a low open car of the sort they call gondolas
coming covered with canvas I stood until it had al
most passed then jumped and caught the rear hand
rods and pulled up I crawled down between the gon
dola and the shelter of the high freightcar behind I
did not think any one had seen me I was holding to
the handrods and crouching low my feet on the coup
ling We were almost opposite the bridge I remem
bered the guard As we passed him he looked at me
He was a boy and his helmet was too big for him I
stared at him contemptuously and he looked away He
thought I had something to do with the train

We were past I saw him still looking uncomfort




able watching the other cars pass and I stooped to see
how the canvas was fastened It had grummets and was
laced down at the edge with cord I took out my knife
cut the cord and put my arm under There were hard
bulges under the canvas that tightened in the rain I
looked up and ahead There was a guard on the
freightcar ahead but he was looking forward I let
go of the handrails and ducked under the canvas My
forehead hit something that gave me a violent bump
and I felt blood on my face but I crawled on in and lay
flat Then I turned around and fastened down the can
vas

I was in under the canvas with guns They smelled
cleanly of oil and grease I lay and listened to the
rain on the canvas and the clicking of the car over the
rails There was a little light came through and I lay
and looked at the guns They had their canvas jackets
on I thought they must have been sent ahead from
the third army The bump on my forehead was swollen
and I stopped the bleeding by lying still and letting it
coagulate then picked away the dried blood except over
the cut It was nothing I had no handkerchief but
feeling with my fingers I washed away where the dried
blood had been with rainwater that dripped from the
canvas and wiped it clean with the sleeve of my coat
I did not want to look conspicuous I knew I would
have to get out before they got to Mestre because they
would be taking care of these guns They had no guns
to lose or forget about I was terrifically hungry



CHAPTER XXXII

Lying on the floor of the flatcar with the guns be
side me under the canvas I was wet cold and very hun
gry Finally I rolled over and lay flat on my stomach
with my head on my arms My knee was stiff but it
had been very satisfactory Valentini had done a fine
job I had done half the retreat on foot and swum part
of the Tagliamento with his knee It was his knee all
right The other knee was mine Doctors did things
to you and then it was not your body any more The
head was mine and the inside of the belly It was very
hungry in there I could feel it turn over on itself The
head was mine but not to use not to think with  only
to remember and not too much remember

I could remember Catherine but I knew I would get
crazy if I thought about her when I was not sure yet I
would see her so I would not think about her only
about her a little only about her with the car going
slowly and clickingly and some light through the can
vas and my lying with Catherine on the floor of the
car Hard as the floor of the car to lie not thinking
only feeling having been away too long the clothes
wet and the floor moving only a little each time and
lonesome inside and alone with wet clothing and hard
floor for a wife

You did not love the floor of a flatcar nor guns with
canvas jackets and the smell of vaselined metal or a
canvas that rain leaked through although it is very
fine under a canvas and pleasant with guns but you
loved some one else whom now you knew was not even
to be pretended there  you seeing now very clearly and





coldly  not so coldly as clearly and emptily You saw
emptily lying on your stomach having been present
when one army moved back and another came forward
You had lost your cars and your men as a floorwalker
loses the stock of his department in a fire There was
however no insurance You were out of it now You
had no more obligation If they shot floorwalkers af
ter a fire in the department store because they spoke
with an accent they had always had then certainly the
floorwalkers would not be expected to return when the
store opened again for business They might seek other
employment if there was any other employment and
the police did not get them

Anger was washed away in the river along with any
obligation Although that ceased when the carabiniere
put his hands on my collar I would like to have had
the uniform off although I did not care much about the
outward forms I had taken off the stars but that was
for convenience It was no point of honor I was not
against them I was through I wished them all the
luck There were the good ones and the brave ones and
the calm ones and the sensible ones and they deserved
it But it was not my show any more and I wished this
bloody train would get to Mestre and I would eat and
stop thinking I would have to stop

Piani would tell them they had shot me They went
through the pockets and took the papers of the people
they shot They would not have my papers They might
call me drowned I wondered what they would hear in
the States Dead from wounds and other causes Good
Christ I was hungry I wondered what had become of
the priest at the mess And Rinaldi He was probably
atPordenone If they had not gone further back Well
I would never see him now I would never see any of




them now That life was over I did not think he had
syphilis It was not a serious disease anyway if you
took it in time they said But he would worry I
would worry too if I had it Any one would worry

I was not made to think I was made to eat My
God yes Eat and drink and sleep with Catherine
Tonight maybe No that was impossible But to
morrow night and a good meal and sheets and never
going away again except together Probably have to
go damned quickly She would go I knew she would
go When would we go  That was something to think
about It was getting dark I lay and thought where
we would go There were many places



BOOK IV



CHAPTER XXXIII

I dropped off the train in Milan as it slowed to come
into the station early in the morning before it was light
I crossed the track and came out between some build
ings and down onto the street A wine shop was open
and I went in for some coffee It smelled of early
morning of swept dust spoons in coffeeglasses and
the wet circles left by wineglasses The proprietor was
behind the bar Two soldiers sat at a table I stood at
the bar and drank a glass of coffee and ate a piece of
bread The coffee was gray with milk and I skimmed
the milk scum off the top with a piece of bread The
proprietor looked at me

You want a glass of grappa

No thanks

On me he said and poured a small glass and
pushed it toward me Whats happening at the front 

I would not know

They are drunk he said moving his hand toward
the two soldiers I could believe him They looked
drunk

Tell me he said what is happening at the
front

I would not know about the front

I saw you come down the wall You came off the
train

There is a big retreat

I read the papers What happens Is it over

I dont think so

He filled the glass with grappa from a short bottle
If you are in trouble he said I can keep you

S3




lam not in trouble

Where does one stay

In the building Many stay here Any who are in
trouble stay here

can

He wiped off the bar

It is hard now to leave the country but in no way
impossible

I have no wish to leave

You can stay here as long as you want You will
see what sort of man I am

I have to go this morning but I will remember the
address to return

He shook his head You wont come back if you
talk like that I thought you were in real trouble

I am in no trouble But I value the address of a
friend

I put a tenlira note on the bar to pay for the coffee

Have a grappa with me I said

It is not necessary

Have one

He poured the two glasses

Remember he said Come here Do not let other
people take you in Here you are all right

I am sure

You are sure

Yes




He was serious Then let me tell you one thing
Do not go about with that coat

Why

On the sleeves it shows very plainly where the stars
have been cut away The cloth is a different color

I did not say anything

If you have no papers I can give you papers

What papers

Leavepapers

I have no need for papers I have papers

All right he said But if you need papers I can
get what you wish

How much are such papers

It depends on what they are The price is reason
able

I dont need any now

He shrugged his shoulders

Im all right I said

When I went out he said Dont forget that I am
your friend

No

I will see you again he said

f Good I said

Outside I kept away from the station where there
were military police and picked up a cab at the edge
of the little park I gave the driver the address of the
hospital At the hospital I went to the porters lodge
His wife embraced me He shook my hand

You are back You are safe

Yes

Have you had breakfast

Yes

asked






Fine

No thank you Tell me is Miss Barkley here at the
hospital now

Miss Barkley

His girl the wife said She patted my arm and
smiled

No the porter said She is away

My heart went down You are sure I mean the
tall blonde English young lady

I am sure She is gone to Stresa

When did she go

She went two days ago with the other lady Eng
lish

Good I said I wish you to do something for me
Do not tell any one you have seen me It is very im
portant

I wont tell any one the porter said I gave him
a tenlira note He pushed it away

I promise you I will tell no one he said I dont
want any money

What can we do for you Signor Tenente his
wife asked

Only that I said

We are dumb the porter said You will let me
know anything I can do 

Yes I said Goodby I will see you again

They stood in the door looking after me

I got into the cab and gave the driver the address of
Simmons one of the men I knew who was studying
singing

Simmons lived a long way out in the town toward




the Porta Magenta He was still in bed and sleepy
when I went to see him

You get up awfully early Henry he said

I came in on the early train

Whats all this retreat Were you at the front
Will you have a cigarette Theyre in that box on the
table It was a big room with a bed beside the wall
a piano over on the far side and a dresser and table
I sat on a chair by the bed Simmons sat propped up
by the pillows and smoked

So am I he said Im always in a jam Wont
you smoke

No I said Whats the procedure in going to
Switzerland

For you The Italians wouldnt let you out of the
country

it or not I looked out of the window Ill go down
and let my cab go

Come back up my dear fellow and well have break
fast He stepped out of bed stood straight took a
deep breath and commenced doing bending exercises
I went downstairs and paid off the cab



CHAPTER XXXIV

In civilian clothes I felt a masquerader I had been
in uniform a long time and I missed the feeling of
being held by your clothes The trousers felt very
floppy I had bought a ticket at Milan for Stresa I
had also bought a new hat I could not wear Sims
hat but his clothes were fine They smelled of tobacco
and as I sat in the compartment and looked out the win
dow the new hat felt very new and the clothes very old
I myself felt as sad as the wet Lombard country that
was outside through the window There were some
aviators in the compartment who did not think much
of me They avoided looking at me and were very
scornful of a civilian my age I did not feel insulted
In the old days I would have insulted them and picked
a fight They got off at Gallarate and I was glad to be
alone I had the paper but I did not read it because I
did not want to read about the war I was going to
forget the war I had made a separate peace I felt
damned lonely and was glad when the train got to
Stresa

At the station I had expected to see the porters from
the hotels but there was no one The season had been
over a long time and no one met the train I got down
from the train with my bag it was Sims bag and very
light to carry being empty except for two shirts and
stood under the roof of the station in the rain while
the train went on I found a man in the station and
asked him if he knew what hotels were open The Grand
Hotel  des Isles Borromees was open and several small
hotels that stayed open all the year I started in the





rain for the Isles Borromees carrying my bag I saw a
carriage coming down the street and signalled to the
driver It was better to arrive in a carriage We drove
up to the carriage entrance of the big hotel and the con
cierge came out with an umbrella and was very polite

I took a good room It was very big and light and
looked out on the lake The clouds were down over the
lake but it would be beautiful with the sunlight I was
expecting my wife I said There was a big double bed
a letto matrimoniale with a satin coverlet The hotel
was very luxurious I went down the long halls down
the wide stairs through the rooms to the bar I knew
the barman and sat on a high stool and ate salted al
monds and potato chips The martini felt cool and
clean

What are you doing here in borghese the barman
asked after he had mixed a second martini

I am on leave Convalescingleave

There is no one here I dont know why they keep
the hotel open

Have you been fishing 

Ive caught some beautiful pieces Trolling this
time of year you catch some beautiful pieces

Did you ever get the tobacco I sent

Yes Didnt you get my card

I laughed I had not been able to get the tobacco
It was American pipetobacco that he wanted but my
relatives had stopped sending it or it was being held up
Anyway it never came

Ill get some somewhere I said Tell me have you
seen two English girls in the town They came here
day before yesterday

They are not at the hotel

They are nurses




I have seen two nurses Wait a minute I will find
out where they are

One of them is my wife I said I have come
here to meet her

The other is my wife

I am not joking

Pardon my stupid joke he said I did not under
stand He went away and was gone quite a little
while I ate olives salted almonds and potato chips
and looked at myself in civilian clothes in the mirror be
hind the bar The bartender came back They are at
the little hotel near the station he said

How about some sandwiches 

Ill ring for some You understand there is nothing
here now there are no people

Isnt there really any one at all

Yes There are a few people

The sandwiches came and I ate three and drank a
couple more martinis I had never tasted anything so
cool and clean They made me feel civilized I had had
too much red wine bread cheese bad coffee and grappa
I sat on the high stool before the pleasant mahogany
the brass and the mirrors and did not think at all The
barman asked me some question

Dont talk about the war I said The war was a
long way away Maybe there wasnt any war There
was no war here Then I realized it was over for me
But I did not have the feeling that it was really over
I had the feeling of a boy who thinks of what is happen
ing at a certain hour at the schoolhouse from which he
has played truant

Catherine and Helen Ferguson were at supper when
I came to their hotel Standing in the hallway I saw




them at table Catherines face was away from me and
I saw the line of her hair and her cheek and her lovely
neck and shoulders Ferguson was talking She stopped
when I came in

My God she said

Hello I said

Why its you Catherine said Her face lighted
up She looked too happy to believe it I kissed her
Catherine blushed and I sat down at the table

Youre a fine mess Ferguson said What are
you doing here Have you eaten

No The girl who was serving the meal came in
and I told her to bring a plate for me Catherine looked
at me all the time her eyes happy

What are you doing in mufti  Ferguson asked

Im in the Cabinet

Youre in some mess

Cheer up Fergy Cheer up just a little

Im not cheered by seeing you I know the mess
youve gotten this girl into Youre no cheerful sight
to me

Catherine smiled at me and touched me with her
foot under the table

No one got me in a mess Fergy I get in my own
messes

I cant stand him Ferguson said Hes done
nothing hut ruin you with his sneaking Italian tricks
Americans are worse than Italians

The Scotch are such a moral people Catherine
said

I dont mean that I mean his Italian sneakiness

Am I sneaky Fergy

You are Youre worse than sneaky Youre like a




snake A snake with an Italian uniform with a cape
around your neck

I havent got an Italian uniform now

Thats just another example of your sneakiness
You had a love affair all summer and got this girl with
child and now I suppose youll sneak off

I smiled at Catherine and she smiled at me

Well both sneak off she said

Youre two of the same thing Ferguson said
Im ashamed of you Catherine Barkley You have
no shame and no honor and youre as sneaky as he is

Dont Fergy Catherine said and patted her hand
Dont denounce me You know we like each other

Take your hand away Ferguson said Her face
was red If you had any shame it would be different
But youre God knows how many months gone with
child and you think its a joke and are all smiles because
your seducers come back Youve no shame and no
feelings She began to cry Catherine went over and
put her arm around her As she stood comforting Fer
guson I could see no change in her figure

I dont care Ferguson sobbed I think its dread
ful

There there Fergy Catherine comforted her
Ill be ashamed Dont cry Fergy Dont cry old
Fergy

Im not crying Ferguson sobbed Im not crying
Except for the awful thing youve gotten into She
looked at me I hate you she said She cant make
me not hate you You dirty sneaking American Ital
ian Her eyes and nose were red with crying

Catherine smiled at me

Dont you smile at him with your arm around me

Youre unreasonable Fergy




I know it Ferguson sobbed You mustnt mind
me either of you Im so upset Im not reasonable I
know it I want you both to be happy

Were happy Catherine said Youre a sweet
Fergy

Ferguson cried again I dont want you happy the
way you are Why dont you get married  You havent
got another wife have you

No I said Catherine laughed

Its nothing to laugh about Ferguson said
Plenty of them have other wives

Well be married Fergy Catherine said if it
will please you

Not to please me You should want to be married

Weve been very busy

Yes I know Busy making babies I thought
she was going to cry again but she went into bitterness
instead I suppose youll go off with him now to
night

Yes said Catherine If he wants me

What about me

Are you afraid to stay here alone

Yes I am

Then Ill stay with you

No go on with him Go with him right away
Im sick of seeing both of you

Wed better finish dinner

No Go right away

Fergy be reasonable

I say get out right away Go away both of you

Lets go then I said I was sick of Fergy

You do want to go You see you want to leave me
even to eat dinner alone Ive always wanted to go to




the Italian lakes and this is how it is Oh Oh she
sobbed then looked at Catherine and choked

Well stay till after dinner Catherine said And
ril not leave you alone if you want me to stay I
wont leave you alone Fergy

No No I want you to go I want you to go
She wiped her eyes Im so unreasonable Please
dont mind me

The girl who served the meal had been upset by all
the crying Now as she brought in the next course
she seemed relieved that things were better

That night at the hotel in our room with the long
empty hall outside and our shoes outside the door a
thick carpet on the floor of the room outside the win
dows the rain falling and in the room light and pleas
ant and cheerful then the light out and it exciting with
smooth sheets and the bed comfortable feeling that we
had come home feeling no longer alone waking in the
night to find the other one there and not gone away
all other things were unreal We slept when we were
tired and if we woke the other one woke too so one
was not alone Often a man wishes to be alone and a
girl wishes to be alone too and if they love each other
they are jealous of that in each other but I can truly
say we never felt that We could feel alone when we
were together alone against the others It has only
happened to me like that once I have been alone while
I was with many girls and that is the way that you can
be most lonely But we were never lonely and never
afraid when we were together I know that the night
is not the same as the day  that all things are different
that the things of the night cannot be explained in the
day because they do not then exist and the night can




be a dreadful time for lonely people once their loneli
ness has started But with Catherine there was almost
no difference in the night except that it was an even
better time If people bring so much courage to this
world the world has to kill them to break them so of
course it kills them The world breaks every one and
afterward many are strong at the broken places But
those that will not break it kills It kills the very good
and the very gentle and the very brave impartially If
you are none of these you can be sure it will kill you
too but there will be no special hurry

I remember waking in the morning Catherine was
asleep and the sunlight was coming in through the win
dow The rain had stopped and I stepped out of bed
and across the floor to the window Down below were
the gardens bare now but beautifully regular the
gravel paths the trees the stone wall by the lake and the
lake in the sunlight with the mountains beyond I
stood at the window looking out and when I turned
away I saw Catherine was awake and watching me

How are you darling  she said Isnt it a lovely
day

How do you feel 

I feel very well We had a lovely night

Do you want breakfast

She wanted breakfast So did I and we had it in
bed the November sunlight coming in the window and
the breakfast tray across my lap

Dont you want the paper You always wanted the
paper in the hospital

No I said I dont want the paper now

Was it so bad you dont want even to read about
it




I dont want to read about it

I wish I had been with you so I would know about
it too

Til tell you about it if I ever get it straight in my
head

But wont they arrest you if they catch you out of
uniform

Theyll probably shoot me

Then well not stay here Well get out of the
country

Id thought something of that

Well get out Darling you shouldnt take silly
chances Tell me how did you come from Mestre to
Milan

I came on the train I was in uniform then

Werent you in danger then

Not much I had an old order of movement I
fixed the dates on it in Mestre

Darling youre liable to be arrested here any time
I wont have it Its silly to do something like that
Where would we be if they took you off

Lets not think about it Im tired of thinking
about it

What would you do if they came to arrest you

Shoot them

You see how silly you are I wont let you go out of
the hotel until we leave here

Where are we going to go

Please dont be that way darling Well go where
ever you say But please find some place to go right
away

Switzerland is down the lake we can go there

That will be lovely




It was clouding over outside and the lake was dark
ening

1 wish we did not always have to live like crimi
nals I said

Darling dont be that way You havent lived like
a criminal very long And we never live like criminals
Were going to have a fine time

I feel like a criminal Ive deserted from the army

Darling please be sensible Its not deserting from
the army Its only the Italian army

I laughed Youre a fine girl Lets get back into
bed I feel fine in bed

A little while later Catherine said You dont feel
like a criminal do you

No I said Not when Im with you

Youre such a silly boy she said But Ill look
after you Isnt it splendid darling that I dont have
any morningsickness

Its grand

You dont appreciate what a fine wife you have
But I dont care Ill get you some place where they
cant arrest you and then well have a lovely time

Lets go there right away

We will darling Ill go any place any time you
wish

Lets not think about anything

All right



CHAPTER XXXV

Catherine went along the lake to the little hotel to
see Ferguson and I sat in the bar and read the papers
There were comfortable leather chairs in the bar and I
sat in one of them and read until the barman came in
The army had not stood at the Tagliamento They
were falling back to the Piave I remembered the
Piave The railroad crossed it near San Dona going
up to the front It was deep and slow there and quite
narrow Down below there were mosquito marshes
and canals There were some lovely villas Once be
fore the war going up to Cortina DAmpezzo I had
gone along it for several hours in the hills Up there
it looked like a trout stream flowing swiftly with shal
low stretches and pools under the shadow of the rocks
The road turned off from it at Cadore I wondered
how the army that was up there would come down
The barman came in

Count Greffi was asking for you he said

Who

Count Grefifi You remember the old man who was
here when you were here before

Is he here

Yes hes here with his niece I told him you were
here He wants you to play billiards

Where is he

Hes taking a walk

How is he

Hes younger than ever He drank three cham
pagne cocktails last night before dinner

Hows his billiard game




Good He beat me When I told him you were
here he was very pleased Theres nobody here for him
to play with

Count Greffi was ninety four years old He had
been a contemporary of Metternich and was an old
man with white hair and mustache and beautiful man
ners He had been in the diplomatic service of both
Austria and Italy and his birthday parties were the
great social event of Milan He was living to be one
hundred years old and played a smoothly fluent game
of billiards that contrasted with his own ninety four
yearold brittleness I had met him when I had been
at Stresa once before out of season and while we
played billiards we drank champagne I thought it was
a splendid custom and he gave me fifteen points in a
hundred and beat me

Why didnt you tell me he was here

I forgot it

Who else is here

No one you know There are only six people alto
gether

What are you doing now

Nothing

Come on out fishing

I could come for an hour

Come on Bring the trolling line

The barman put on a coat and we went out We
went down and got a boat and I rowed while the bar
man sat in the stern and let out the line with a spinner
and a heavy sinker on the end to troll for lake trout
We rowed along the shore the barman holding the line
in his hand and giving it occasional jerks forward
Stresa looked very deserted from the lake There were
the long rows of bare trees the big hotels and the




closed villas I rowed across to Isola Bella and went
close to the walls where the water deepened sharply
and you saw the rock wall slanting down in the clear
water and then up and along to the fishermans island
The sun was under a cloud and the water was dark and
smooth and very cold We did not have a strike though
we saw some circles on the water from rising fish

I rowed up opposite the fishermans island where
there were boats drawn up and men were mending nets

Should we get a drink

All right 

I brought the boat up to the stone pier and the bar
man pulled in the line coiling it on the bottom of the
boat and hooking the spinner on the edge of the gun
wale I stepped out and tied the boat We went into a
little cafe sat at a bare wooden table and ordered ver
mouth

Are you tired from rowing

No

Ill row back he said

I like to row

Maybe if you hold the line it will change the luck

All right

Tell me how goes the war

Rotten

I dont have to go Im too old like Count Greffi

Maybe youll have to go yet

Next year theyll call my class But I wont go

What will you do

Get out of the country I wouldnt go to war I
was at the war once in Abyssinia Nix Why do you
go

I dont know I was a fool

Have another vermouth




All right

The barman rowed back We trolled up the lake be
yond Stresa and then down not far from shore I
held the taut line and felt the faint pulsing of the spin
ner revolving while I looked at the dark November
water of the lake and the deserted shore The barman
rowed with long strokes and on the forward thrust of
the boat the line throbbed Once I had a strike the
line hardened suddenly and jerked back I pulled and
felt the live weight of the trout and then the line
throbbed again I had missed him

Did he feel big

Pretty big

Once when I was out trolling alone I had the line
in my teeth and one struck and nearly took my mouth
out

The best way is to have it over your leg I said
Then you feel it and dont lose your teeth

I put my hand in the water It was very cold We
were almost opposite the hotel now

I have to go in the barman said to be there for
eleven oclock Lheure du cocktail

All right

I pulled in the line and wrapped it on a stick notched
at each end The barman put the boat in a little slip in
the stone wall and locked it with a chain and padlock

Any time you want it he said Ill give you the
key 

Thanks

We went up to the hotel and in to the bar I did not
want another drink so early in the morning so I went
up to our room The maid had just finished doing the
room and Catherine was not back yet I lay down on
the bed and tried to keep from thinking




When Catherine came back it was all right again
Ferguson was downstairs she said She was coming
to lunch

I knew you wouldnt mind Catherine said

No I said

Whats the matter darling

I dont know

I know You havent anything to do All you have
is me and I go away

Thats true

Im sorry darling I know it must be a dreadful
feeling to have nothing at all suddenly

My life used to be full of everything I said
Now if you arent with me I havent a thing in the
world

But Ill be with you I was only gone for two
hours Isnt there anything you can do

I went fishing with the barman

Wasnt it fun

Yes

Dont think about me when Im not here

Thats the way I worked it at the front But there
was something to do then

Othello with his occupation gone she teased

Othello was a nigger I said Besides Im not
jealous Im just so in love with you that there isnt
anything else

Will you be a good boy and be nice to Ferguson

Im always nice to Ferguson unless she curses me

Be nice to her Think how much we have and she
hasnt anything

I dont think she wants what we have

You dont know much darling for such a wise
boy




Til be nice to her

I know you will Youre so sweet

She wont stay afterward will she

No Ill get rid of her

And then well come up here

Of course What do you think I want to do

We went downstairs to have lunch with Ferguson
She was very impressed by the hotel and the splendor
of the diningroom We had a good lunch with a
couple of bottles of white capri Count Greffi came
into the diningroom and bowed to us His niece who
looked a little like my grandmother was with him I
told Catherine and Ferguson about him and Ferguson
was very impressed The hotel was very big and grand
and empty but the food was good the wine was very
pleasant and finally the wine made us all feel very well
Catherine had no need to feel any better She was
very happy Ferguson became quite cheerful I felt
very well myself After lunch Ferguson went back to
her hotel She was going to lie down for a while after
lunch she said

Along late in the afternoon some one knocked on
our door

Who is it

The Count Greffi wishes to know if you will play
billiards with him

I looked at my watch  I had taken it off and it was
under the pillow

Do you have to go darling Catherine whispered

I think Td better The watch was a quarterpast
four oclock Out loud I said Tell the Count Greffi
I will be in the billiardroom at five oclock

At a quarter to five I kissed Catherine goodby and
went into the bathroom to dress Knotting my tie and




looking in the glass I looked strange to myself in the
civilian clothes I must remember to buy some more
shirts and socks

Will you be away a long time Catherine asked
She looked lovely in the bed Would you hand me the
brush

I watched her brushing her hair holding her head so
the weight of her hair all came on one side It was
dark outside and the light over the head of the bed
shone on her hair and on her neck and shoulders I
went over and kissed her and held her hand with the
brush and her head sunk back on the pillow I kissed
her neck and shoulders I felt faint with loving her so
much

I dont want to go away

I dont want you to go away

I wont go then

Yes Go Its only for a little while and then
youll come back

Well have dinner up here

Hurry and come back

I found the Count Greffi in the billiardroom He
was practising strokes looking very fragile under the
light that came down above the billiard table On a card
table a little way beyond the light was a silver icing
bucket with the necks and corks of two champagne
bottles showing above the ice The Count Greffi
straightened up when I came toward the table and
walked toward me He put out his hand It is such a
great pleasure that you are here You were very kind
to come to play with me

It was very nice of you to ask me

Are you quite well They told me you were




wounded on the Isonzo I hope you are well again

Im very well Have you been well

Oh I am always well But I am getting old I
detect signs of age now

I cant believe it

Yes Do you want to know one It is easier for
me to talk Italian I discipline myself but I find when
I am tired that it is so much easier to talk Italian So
I know I must be getting old

We could talk Italian I am a little tired too

Oh but when you are tired it will be easier for you
to talk English

American

Yes American You will please talk American It
is a delightful language

I hardly ever see Americans

You must miss them One misses ones country
men and especially ones countrywomen I know that
experience Should we play or are you too tired

Im not really tired I said that for a joke What
handicap will you give me

Have you been playing very much

None at all

You play very well Ten points in a hundred

You flatter me

Fifteen

That would be fine but you will beat me

Should we play for a stake You always wished to
play for a stake

I think wed better

All right I will give you eighteen points and we
will play for a franc a point

He played a lovely game of billiards and with the




handicap I was only four ahead at fifty Count Greffi
pushed a button on the wall to ring for the barman

Open one bottle please he said Then to me We
will take a little stimulant The wine was icy cold and
very dry and good

Should we talk Italian Would you mind very
much It is my great weakness now

We went on playing sipping the wine between shots
speaking in Italian but talking little concentrated on
the game Count Greffi made his one hundredth point
and with the handicap I was only at ninetyfour He
smiled and patted me on the shoulder

Now we will drink the other bottle and you will
tell me about the war He waited for me to sit down

About anything else I said

You dont want to talk about it Good What
have you been reading

Nothing I said Im afraid I am very dull

No But you should read

What is there written in wartime

There is Le Feu by a Frenchman Barbusse
There is Mr Britling Sees Through It 

No he doesnt

What

He doesnt see through it Those books were at the
hospital

Then you have been reading

Yes but nothing any good

I thought Mr Britling a very good study of the
English middleclass soul

I dont know about the soul

Poor boy We none of us know about the soul
Are you Croyant

At night




Count Greffi smiled and turned the glass with his fin
gers I had expected to become more devout as I grow
older but somehow I havent he said It is a great
pity

Would you like to live after death I asked and
instantly felt a fool to mention death But he did not
mind the word

It would depend on the life This life is very pleas
ant I would like to live forever he smiled I very
nearly have

We were sitting in the deep leather chairs the cham
pagne in the icebucket and our glasses on the table
between us

If you ever live to be as old as I am you will find
many things strange

You never seem old

It is the body that is old Sometimes I am afraid
I will break off a finger as one breaks a stick of chalk
And the spirit is no older and not much wiser

You are wise

No that is the great fallacy the wisdom of old
men They do not grow wise They grow careful

Perhaps that is wisdom

It is a very unattractive wisdom What do you
value most

Some one I love

With me it is the same That is not wisdom Do
you value life

Yes

So do I Because it is all I have And to give
birthday parties he laughed You are probably wiser
than I am You do not give birthday parties

We both drank the wine

What do you think of the war really I asked




I think it is stupid

Who will win it

Italy

Why

They are a younger nation

Do younger nations always win wars

They are apt to for a time

Then what happens

They become older nations

You said you were not wise

Dear boy that is not wisdom That is cynicism

It sounds very wise to me

Its not particularly I could quote you the ex
amples on the other side But it is not bad Have we
finished the champagne

Almost

Should we drink some more Then I must dress

Perhaps wed better not now

You are sure you dont want more

Yes He stood up

I hope you will be very fortunate and very happy
and very very healthy

Thank you And I hope you will live forever

Thank you I have And if you ever become de
vout pray for me if I am dead I am asking several of
my friends to do that I had expected to become de
vout myself but it has not come I thought he smiled
sadly but I could not tell He was so old and his face
was very wrinkled so that a smile used so many lines
that all gradations were lost

I might become very devout I said Anyway I
will pray for you

I had always expected to become devout All my




family died very devout But somehow it does not



come

T4



Its too early

Maybe it is too late Perhaps I have outlived my
religious feeling

My own comes only at night

Then too you are in love Do not forget that is a
religious feeling

You believe so

Of course He took a step toward the table You
were very kind to play

It was a great pleasure

We will walk up stairs together



CHAPTER XXXVI

That night there was a storm and I woke to hear
the rain lashing the windowpanes It was coming in
the open window Some one had knocked on the door
I went to the door very softly not to disturb Catherine
and opened it The barman stood there He wore his
overcoat and carried his wet hat

Can I speak to you Tenente

Whats the matter 

Its a very serious matter

I looked around The room was dark I saw the
water on the floor from the window Come in I
said I took him by the arm into the bathroom  locked
the door and put on the light I sat down on the edge
of the bathtub

Whats the matter Emilio Are you in trouble

No You are Tenente

Yes

They are going to arrest you in the morning

Yes

I came to tell you I was out in the town and I
heard them talking in a cafe

He stood there his coat wet holding his wet hat and
said nothing

Why are they going to arrest me

For something about the war

Do you know what

No But I know that they know you were here be
fore as an officer and now you are here out of uniform
After this retreat they arrest everybody

I thought a minute





What time do they come to arrest me

In the morning I dont know the time

What do you say to do

He put his hat in the washbowl It was very wet
and had been dripping on the floor

If you have nothing to fear an arrest is nothing
But it is always bad to be arrested  especially now

I dont want to be arrested

Then go to Switzerland

How

In my boat

There is a storm I said

The storm is over It is rough but you will be all
right

When should we go

Right away They might come to arrest you early
in the morning

What about our bags

Get them packed Get your lady dressed I will
take care of them

Where will you be

I will wait here I dont want any one to see me
outside in the hall

I opened the door closed it and went into the bed
room Catherine was awake

What is it darling

Its all right Cat I said Would you like to get
dressed right away and go in a boat to Switzerland

Would you

No I said Id like to go back to bed

What is it about

The barman says they are going to arrest me in the
morning

Is the barman crazy




No

Then please hurry darling and get dressed so we
can start She sat up on the side of the bed She
was still sleepy Is that the barman in the bathroom

Yes

Then I wont wash Please look the other way
darling and Ill be dressed in just a minute

I saw her white back as she took off her nightgown
and then I looked away because she wanted me to She
was beginning to be a little big with the child and she
did not want me to see her I dressed hearing the rain
on the windows I did not have much to put in my bag

Theres plenty of room in my bag Cat if you need
any

Im almost packed she said Darling Im aw
fully stupid but why is the barman in the bathroom

Sh  hes waiting to take our bags down

Hes awfully nice

Hes an old friend I said I nearly sent him some
pipetobacco once

I looked out the open window at the dark night I
could not see the lake only the dark and the rain but
the wind was quieter

Im ready darling Catherine said

All right I went to the bathroom door Here
are the bags Emilio I said The barman took the two
bags

Youre very good to help us Catherine said

Thats nothing lady the barman said Im glad
to help you just so I dont get in trouble myself Lis
ten he said to me Ill take these out the servants
stairs and to the boat You just go out as though you
were going for a walk

Its a lovely night for a walk Catherine said




Its a bad night all right

Im glad Fve an umbrella Catherine said

We walked down the hall and down the wide thickly
carpeted stairs At the foot of the stairs by the door
the porter sat behind his desk

He looked surprised at seeing us

 Youre not going out sir he said

Yes I said Were going to see the storm along
the lake

Havent you got an umbrella sir

No I said This coat sheds water

He looked at it doubtfully Til get you an umbrella
sir he said He went away and came back with a big
umbrella It is a little big sir he said I gave him
a tenlira note Oh you are too good sir Thank you
very much he said He held the door open and we
went out into the rain He smiled at Catherine and she
smiled at him Dont stay out in the storm he said
You will get wet sir and lady He was only the sec
ond porter and his English was still literally translated

Well be back I said We walked down the path
under the giant umbrella and out through the dark wet
gardens to the road and across the road to the trellised
pathway along the lake The wind was blowing off
shore now It was a cold wet November wind and I
knew it was snowing in the mountains We came along
past the chained boats in the slips along the quay to
where the barmans boat should be The water was
dark against the stone The barman stepped out from
beside the row of trees

The bags are in the boat he said

I want to pay you for the boat I said

How much money have you

Not so much




You send me the money later That will be all
right

How much

What you want

Tell me how much

If you get through send me five hundred francs
You wont mind that if you get through 

All right

Here are sandwiches He handed me a package
Everything there was in the bar Its all here This
is a bottle of brandy and a bottle of wine I put them
in my bag Let me pay you for those

All right give me fifty lire

I gave it to him The brandy is good he said
You dont need to be afraid to give it to your lady
She better get in the boat He held the boat it rising
and falling against the stone wall and I helped Cathe
rine in She sat in the stern and pulled her cape around
her

You know where to go

Up the lake

You know how far

Past Luino

Past Luino Cannero Cannobio Tranzano You
arent in Switzerland until you come to Brissago You
have to pass Monte Tamara

What time is it Catherine asked

Its only eleven oclock I said

If you row all the time you ought to be there by
seven oclock in the morning

Is it that far

Its thirtyfive kilometres

How should we go In this rain we need a com
pass




No Row to Isola Bella Then on the other side of
Isola Madre go with the wind The wind will take you
to Pallanza You will see the lights Then go up the
shore

Maybe the wind will change

No he said This wind will blow like this for
three days It comes straight down from the Matta
rone There is a can to bail with

Let me pay you something for the boat now

No Fd rather take a chance If you get through
you pay me all you can

All right

I dont think youll get drowned

Thats good

Go with the wind up the lake

All right I stepped in the boat

Did you leave the money for the hotel

Yes In an envelope in the room

All right Good luck Tenente

Good luck We thank you many times

You wont thank me if you get drowned

What does he say Catherine asked

He says good luck

Good luck Catherine said Thank you very
much

Are you ready

Yes

He bent down and shoved us off I dug at the water
with the oars then waved one hand The barman waved
back deprecatingly I saw the lights of the hotel and
rowed out rowing straight out until they were out of
sight There was quite a sea running but we were go
ing with the wind



CHAPTER XXXVII

I rowed in the dark keeping the wind in my face
The rain had stopped and only came occasionally in
gusts It was very dark and the wind was cold I
could see Catherine in the stern but I could not see the
water where the blades of the oars dipped The oars
were long and there were no leathers to keep them from
slipping out I pulled raised leaned forward found
the water dipped and pulled rowing as easily as I
could I did not feather the oars because the wind was
with us I knew my hands would blister and I wanted
to delay it as long as I could The boat was light and
rowed easily I pulled it along in the dark water I
could not see and hoped we would soon come opposite
Pallanza

We never saw Pallanza The wind was blowing up
the lake and we passed the point that hides Pallanza in
the dark and never saw the lights When we finally
saw some lights much further up the lake and close to
the shore it was Intra But for a long time we did not
see any lights nor did we see the shore but rowed stead
ily in the dark riding with the waves Sometimes I
missed the water with the oars in the dark as a wave
lifted the boat It was quite rough but I kept on row
ing until suddenly we were close ashore against a point
of rock that rose beside us  the waves striking against
it rushing high up then falling back I pulled hard
on the right oar and backed water with the other and
we went out into the lake again  the point was out of
sight and we were going on up the lake

Were across the lake I said to Catherine




Werent we going to see Pallanza 

Weve missed it

How are you darling

Im fine

I could take the oars awhile

No Tm fine

Poor Ferguson Catherine said In the morning
shell come to the hotel and find were gone

Im not worrying so much about that I said as
about getting into the Swiss part of the lake before its
daylight and the custom guards see us

Is it a long way

Its thirty some kilometres from here

I rowed all night Finally my hands were so sore I
could hardly close them over the oars We were nearly
smashed up on the shore several times I kept fairly
close to the shore because I was afraid of getting lost
on the lake and losing time Sometimes we were so
close we could see a row of trees and the road along
the shore with the mountains behind The rain stopped
and the wind drove the clouds so that the moon shone
through and looking back I could see the long dark
point of Castagnola and the lake with whitecaps and
beyond the moon on the high snow mountains Then
the clouds came over the moon again and the moun
tains and the lake were gone but it w r as much lighter
than it had been before and we could see the shore I
could see it too clearly and pulled out where they would
not see the boat if there were custom guards along the
Pallanza road When the moon came out again we
could see white villas on the shore on the slopes of the
mountain and the white road where it showed through
the trees All the time I was rowing




The lake widened and across it on the shore at the
foot of the mountains on the other side we saw a few
lights that should be Luino I saw a wedgelike gap be
tween the mountains on the other shore and I thought
that must be Luino If it was we were making good
time I pulled in the oars and lay back on the seat I
was very very tired of rowing My arms and shoulders
and back ached and my hands were sore

I could hold the umbrella Catherine said We
could sail with that with the wind

Can you steer

I think so

You take this oar and hold it under your arm close
to the side of the boat and steer and HI hold the um
brella I went back to the stern and showed her how
to hold the oar I took the big umbrella the porter had
given me and sat facing the bow and opened it It
opened with a clap I held it on both sides sitting
astride the handle hooked over the seat The wind was
full in it and I felt the boat suck forward while I held
as hard as I could to the two edges It pulled hard
The boat was moving fast

Were going beautifully Catherine said All I
could see was umbrella ribs The umbrella strained and
pulled and I felt us driving along with it I braced my
feet and held back on it then suddenly it buckled I
felt a rib snap on my forehead I tried to grab the top
that was bending with the wind and the whole thing
buckled and went inside out and I was astride the
handle of an insideout ripped umbrella where I had
been holding a windfilled pulling sail I unhooked the
handle from the seat laid the umbrella in the bow and
went back to Catherine for the oar She was laughing
She took my hand and kept on laughing




Whats the matter  I took the oar

You looked so funny holding that thing

I suppose so

Dont be cross darling It was awfully funny You
looked about twenty feet broad and very affectionate
holding the umbrella by the edges   she choked

Til row

Take a rest and a drink Its a grand night and
weve come a long way

I have to keep the boat out of the trough of the
waves

Ill get you a drink Then rest a little while dar
ling

I held the oars up and we sailed with them Cathe
rine was opening the bag She handed me the brandy
bottle I pulled the cork with my pocketknife and took
a long drink It was smooth and hot and the heat went
all through me and I felt warmed and cheerful Its
lovely brandy I said The moon was under again but
I could see the shore There seemed to be another point
going out a long way ahead into the lake

Are you warm enough Cat

Im splendid Im a little stiff

Bail out that water and you can put your feet
down

Then I rowed and listened to the oarlocks and the
dip and scrape of the bailing tin under the stern seat

Would you give me the bailer I said I want a
drink

Its awfully dirty

Thats all right Ill rinse it

I heard Catherine rinsing it over the side Then she
handed it to me dipped full of water I was thirsty
after the brandy and the water was icy cold so cold it




made my teeth ache I looked toward the shore We
were closer to the long point There were lights in the
bay ahead

Thanks Isaid and handed back the tin pail

Youre ever so welcome Catherine said Theres
much more if you want it

Dont you want to eat something

No Ill be hungry in a little while Well save it
till then

All right

What looked like a point ahead was a long high
headland I went further out in the lake to pass it
The lake was much narrower now The moon was out
again and the guardia di Finanza could have seen our
boat black on the water if they had been watching

How are you Cat I asked

Im all right Where are we

I dont think we have more than about eight miles
more

Thats a long way to row you poor sweet Arent
you dead

No Im all right My hands are sore is all

We went on up the lake There was a break in the
mountains on the right bank a flatteningout with a
low shore line that I thought must be Cannobio I
stayed a long way out because it was from now on that
we ran the most danger of meeting guardia There was
a high domecapped mountain on the other shore a way
ahead I was tired It was no great distance to row
but when you were out of condition it had been a long
way I knew I had to pass that mountain and go up
the lake at least five miles further before we would be
in Swiss water The moon was almost down now but




before it went down the sky clouded over again and it
was very dark I stayed well out in the lake rowing
awhile then resting and holding the oars so that the
wind struck the blades

Let me row awhile Catherine said

I dont think you ought to

Nonsense It would be good for me It would keep
me from being too stiff

I dont think you should Cat

Nonsense Rowing in moderation is very good for
the pregnant lady

All right you row a little moderately Ill go back
then you come up Hold on to both gunwales when you
come up

I sat in the stern with my coat on and the collar
turned up and watched Catherine row She rowed very
well but the oars were too long and bothered her I
opened the bag and ate a couple of sandwiches and took
a drink of the brandy It made everything much better
and I took another drink

Tell me when youre tired I said Then a little
later watch out the oar doesnt pop you in the tummy

If it did  Catherine said between strokes  life
might be much simpler

I took another drink of the brandy

How are you going

All right

Tell me when you want to stop

All right

I took another drink of the brandy then took hold
of the two gunwales of the boat and moved forward

No Im going beautifully

Go on back to the stern Ive had a grand rest




For a while with the brandy I rowed easily and
steadily Then I began to catch crabs and soon I was
just chopping along again with a thin brown taste of
bile from having rowed too hard after the brandy

Give me a drink of water will you I said

Thats easy Catherine said

Before daylight it started to drizzle The wind was
down or we were protected by mountains that bounded
the curve the lake had made When I knew daylight
was coming I settled down and rowed hard I did not
know where we were and I wanted to get into the Swiss
part of the lake When it was beginning to be daylight
we were quite close to the shore I could see the rocky
shore and the trees

Whats that Catherine said I rested on the oars
and listened It was a motor boat chugging out on the
lake I pulled close up to the shore and lay quiet The
chugging came closer then we saw the motor boat in
the rain a little astern of us There were four guardia
difinanza in the stern their alpini hats pulled down their
cape collars turned up and their carbines slung across
their backs They all looked sleepy so early in the morn
ing I could see the yellow on their hats and the yellow
marks on their cape collars The motor boat chugged
on and out of sight in the rain

I pulled out into the lake If we were that close to
the border I did not want to be hailed by a sentry along
the road I stayed out where I could just see the shore
and rowed on for three quarters of an hour in the rain
We heard a motor boat once more but I kept quiet un
til the noise of the engine went away across the lake

I think were in Switzerland Cat I said

Really

Theres no way to know until we see Swiss troops




Or the Swiss navy

The Swiss navys no joke for us That last motor
boat we heard was probably the Swiss navy

If were in Switzerland lets have a big breakfast
They have wonderful rolls and butter and jam in Swit
zerland

It was clear daylight now and a fine rain was falling
The wind was still blowing outside up the lake and we
could see the tops of the whitecaps going away from us
and up the lake I was sure we were in Switzerland
now There were many houses back in the trees from
the shore and up the shore a way was a village with
stone houses some villas on the hills and a church I
had been looking at the road that skirted the shore for
guards but did not see any The road came quite close
to the lake now and I saw a soldier coming out of a
cafe on the road He wore a graygreen uniform and
a helmet like the Germans He had a healthylooking
face and a little toothbrush mustache He looked at us

Wave to him I said to Catherine She waved and
the soldier smiled embarrassedly and gave a wave of his
hand I eased up rowing We were passing the water
front of the village

We must be well inside the border I said

We want to be sure darling We dont want them
to turn us back at the frontier

The frontier is a long way back I think this is the
customs town Im pretty sure its Brissago

Wont there be Italians there There are always
both sides at a customs town

Not in wartime I dont think they let the Italians
cross the frontier

It was a nicelooking little town There were many




fishing boats along the quay and nets were spread on
racks There was a fine November rain falling but it
looked cheerful and clean even with the rain

Should we land then and have breakfast

All right

I pulled hard on the left oar and came in close then
straightened out when we were close to the quay and
brought the boat alongside I pulled in the oars took
hold of an iron ring stepped up on the wet stone and
was in Switzerland I tied the boat and held my hand
down to Catherine

Come on up Cat Its a grand feeling

What about the bags

Leave them in the boat

Catherine stepped up and we were in Switzerland to
gether

What a lovely country she said

Isnt it grand

Lets go and have breakfast 

Isnt it a grand country I love the way it feels
under my shoes

Im so stiff I cant feel it very well But it feels like

fore

Look at the houses Isnt this a fine square
Theres a place we can get breakfast

Isnt the rain fine They never had rain like this in
Italy Its cheerful rain

And were here darling Do you realize were

We went inside the cafe and sat down at a clean




wooden table We were cockeyed excited A splendid
cleanlooking woman with an apron came and asked us
what we wanted

Rolls and jam and coffee Catherine said

Im sorry we havent any rolls in wartime

Bread then

I can make you some toast

All right

I want some eggs fried too

How many eggs for the gentleman

Three

Take four darling

Four eggs

The woman went away I kissed Catherine and held
her hand very tight We looked at each other and at
the cafe

Darling darling isnt it lovely

Its grand I said

I dont mind there not being rolls Catherine said
I thought about them all night But I dont mind it
I dont mind it at all

I suppose pretty soon they will arrest us

Never mind darling Well have breakfast first
You wont mind being arrested after breakfast And
then theres nothing they can do to us Were British
and American citizens in good standing

You have a passport havent you

Of course Oh lets not talk about it Lets be
happy

I couldnt be any happier I said A fat gray cat
with a tail that lifted like a plume crossed the floor to
our table and curved against my leg to purr each time
she rubbed I reached down and stroked her Cath




erine smiled at me very happily Here comes the
coffee  she said

They arrested us after breakfast We took a little
walk through the village then went down to the quay
to get our bags A soldier was standing guard over the
boat

Is this your boat 

Yes 

Where do you come from

Up the lake

Then I have to ask you to come with me

How about the bags

You can carry the bags

I carried the bags and Catherine walked beside me
and the soldier walked along behind us to the old cus
tom house In the custom house a lieutenant very thin
and military questioned us

What nationality are you

American and British

Let me see your passports

I gave him mine and Catherine got hers out of her
handbag

He examined them for a long time

Why do you enter Switzerland this way in a boat

I am a sportsman I said Rowing is my great
sport I always row when I get a chance

Why do you come here

For the winter sport We are tourists and we want
to do the winter sport

This is no place for winter sport

We know it We want to go where they have the
winter sport

What have you been doing in Italy 




I have been studying architecture My cousin has
been studying art

Why do you leave there

We want to do the winter sport With the war go
ing on you cannot study architecture

You will please stay where you are the lieutenant
said He went back into the building with our pass
ports

Youre splendid darling Catherine said Keep
on the same track You want to do the winter sport

Do you know anything about art

Rubens said Catherine

Large and fat I said

Titian Catherine said

Titianhaired I said How about Mantegna

Dont ask hard ones Catherine said I know him
though  very bitter

Very bitter I said Lots of nail holes

You see Ill make you a fine wife Catherine said
Ill be able to talk art with your customers

Here he comes I said The thin lieutenant came
down the length of the custom house holding our pass
ports

I will have to send you into Locarno he said
You can get a carriage and a soldier will go in with
you

All right I said What about the boat

The boat is confiscated What have you in those
bags

He went all through the two bags and held up the
quarterbottle of brandy Would you join me in a
drink I asked

No thank you He straightened up How much
money have you




Twentyfive hundred lire

He was favorably impressed How much has your



cousin







Catherine had a little over twelve hundred lire The
lieutenant was pleased His attitude toward us became
less haughty

If you are going for winter sports he said Wen
gen is the place My father has a very fine hotel at
Wengen It is open all the time

Thats splendid I said Could you give me the
name

I will write it on a card He handed me the card
very politely

The soldier will take you in to Locarno He will
keep your passports I regret this but it is necessary
I have good hopes they will give you a visa or a police
permit at Locarno

He handed the two passports to the soldier and carry
ing the bags we started into the village to order a car
riage Hi the lieutenant called to the soldier He
said something in a German dialect to him The sol
dier slung his rifle on his back and picked up the bags

Its a great country I said to Catherine

Its so practical

Thank you very much I said to the lieutenant
He waved his hand

Service he said We followed our guard into the
village

We drove to Locarno in a carriage with the soldier
sitting on the front seat with the driver At Locarno
we did not have a bad time They questioned us but
they were polite because we had passports and money
I do not think they believed a word of the story and I
thought it was silly but it was like a lawcourt You




did not want something reasonable you wanted some
thing technical and then stuck to it without explana
tions But we had passports and we would spend the
money So they gave us provisional visas At any time
this visa might be withdrawn We were to report to
the police wherever we went

Could we go wherever we wanted Yes Where did
we want to go 

Where do you want to go Cat

Montreux

It is a very nice place the official said I think
you will like that place

Here at Locarno is a very nice place another of
ficial said I am sure you would like it here very
much at Locarno Locarno is a very attractive place

We would like some place where there is winter
sport

There is no winter sport at Montreux

I beg your pardon the other official said I come
from Montreux There is very certainly winter sport
on the Montreux Oberland Bernois railway It would
be false for you to deny that

I do not deny it I simply said there is no winter
sport at Montreux

I question that the other official said I question
that statement

I hold to that statement

I question that statement I myself have lugeed
into the streets of Montreux I have done it not once
but several times Lugeing is certainly winter sport

The other official turned to me

Is lugeing your idea of winter sport sir I tell you
you would be very comfortable here in Locarno You




would find the climate healthy you would find the en
virons attractive You would like it very much

The gentleman has expressed a wish to go to Mon
treux

What is lugeing  I asked

You see he has never even heard of lugeing

That meant a great deal to the second official He
was pleased by that

Lugeing said the first official is tobogganing

I beg to differ the other official shook his head
I must differ again The toboggan is very different
from the luge The toboggan is constructed in Canada
of flat laths The luge is a common sled with runners
Accuracy means something

Couldnt we toboggan I asked

Of course you could toboggan the first official
said You could toboggan very well Excellent Cana
dian toboggans are sold in Montreux Ochs Brothers
sell toboggans They import their own toboggans

The second official turned away Tobogganing he
said requires a special piste You could not toboggan
into the streets of Montreux Where are you stopping
here

We dont know I said We just drove in from
Brissago The carriage is outside

You make no mistake in going to Montreux the
first official said You will find the climate delightful
and beautiful You will have no distance to go for
winter sport

If you really want winter sport the second official
said you will go to the Engadine or to Miirren I
must protest against your being advised to go to Mon
treux for the winter sport

At Les Avants above Montreux there is excellent




winter sport of every sort The champion of Mon
treux glared at his colleague

Gentlemen I said I am afraid we must go My
cousin is very tired We will go tentatively to Mon
treux

I congratulate you the first official shook my hand

I believe that you will regret leaving Locarno the
second official said At any rate you will report to the
police at Montreux

There will be no unpleasantness with the police
the first official assured me You will find all the in
habitants extremely courteous and friendly

Thank you both very much I said We appre
ciate your advice very much

Goodby Catherine said Thank you both very
much

They bowed us to the door the champion of Locarno
a little coldly We went down the steps and into the
carriage

My God darling Catherine said Couldnt we
have gotten away any sooner I gave the name of a
hotel one of the officials had recommended to the driver
He picked up the reins

Youve forgotten the army Catherine said The
soldier was standing by the carriage I gave him a ten
lira note I have no Swiss money yet I said He
thanked me saluted and went off The carriage started
and we drove to the hotel

How did you happen to pick out Montreux I
asked Catherine Do you really want to go there

It was the first place I could think of she said
Its not a bad place We can find some place up in the
mountains

Are you sleepy




Im asleep right now

Well get a good sleep Poor Cat you had a long
bad night

I had a lovely time Catherine said Especially
when you sailed with the umbrella

Can you realize were in Switzerland

No Im afraid Ill wake up and it wont be true

I am too

It is true isnt it darling Im not just driving
down to the stazione in Milan to see you off

I hope not

Dont say that It frightens me Maybe thats
where were going

Im so groggy I dont know I said

Let me see your hands

I put them out They were both blistered raw

Theres no hole in my side I said

Dont be sacrilegious

I felt very tired and vague in the head The exhil
aration was all gone The carriage was going along the
street

Poor hands Catherine said

Dont touch them I said By God I dont know
where we are Where are we going driver The
driver stopped his horse

To the Hotel Metropole Dont you want to go
there

Yes I said Its all right Cat

Its all right darling Dont be upset Well get a
good sleep and you wont feel groggy tomorrow

I get pretty groggy I said Its like a comic
opera today Maybe Im hungry

Youre just tired darling Youll be fine The




carriage pulled up before the hotel Some one came out
to take our bags

I feel all right I said We were down on the
pavement going into the hotel

I know youll be all right Youre just tired
Youve been up a long time

Anyhow were here

Yes were really here

We followed the boy with the bags into the hotel



BOOK V



CHAPTER XXXVIII

That fall the snow came very late We lived in a
brown wooden house in the pine trees on the side of the
mountain and at night there was frost so that there
was thin ice over the water in the two pitchers on the
dresser in the morning Mrs Guttingen came into the
room early in the morning to shut the windows and
started a fire in the tall porcelain stove The pine wood
crackled and sparked and then the fire roared in the
stove and the second time Mrs Guttingen came into the
room she brought big chunks of wood for the fire and
a pitcher of hot water When the room was warm she
brought in breakfast Sitting up in bed eating break
fast we could see the lake and the mountains across the
lake on the French side There was snow on the tops
of the mountains and the lake was a gray steelblue

Outside in front of the chalet a road went up the
mountain The wheel ruts and ridges were iron hard
with the frost and the road climbed steadily through
the forest and up and around the mountain to where
there were meadows and barns and cabins in the
meadows at the edge of the woods looking across the
valley The valley was deep and there was a stream at
the bottom that flowed down into the lake and when
the wind blew across the valley you could hear the
stream in the rocks

Sometimes we went off the road and on a path
through the pine forest The floor of the forest was
soft to walk on  the frost did not harden it as it did the
road But we did not mind the hardness of the road
because we had nails in the soles and heels of our boots





and the heel nails bit on the frozen ruts and with nailed
boots it was good walking on the road and invigorat
ing But it was lovely walking in the woods

In front of the house where we lived the mountain
went down steeply to the little plain along the lake and
we sat on the porch of the house in the sun and saw
the winding of the road down the mountainside and
the terraced vineyards on the side of the lower moun
tain the vines all dead now for the winter and the fields
divided by stone walls and below the vineyards the
houses of the town on the narrow plain along the lake
shore There was an island with two trees on the lake
and the trees looked like the double sails of a fishing
boat The mountains were sharp and steep on the other
side of the lake and down at the end of the lake was
the plain of the Rhone Valley flat between the two
ranges of mountains and up the valley where the
mountains cut it off was the Dent du Midi It was a
high snowy mountain and it dominated the valley but
it was so far away that it did not make a shadow

When the sun was bright we ate lunch on the porch
but the rest of the time we ate upstairs in a small room
with plain wooden walls and a big stcfce in the corner
We bought books and magazines in the town and a
copy of Hoyle and learned many twohanded card
games The small room with the stove was our living
room There were two comfortable chairs and a table
for books and magazines and we played cards on the
diningtable when it was cleared away Mr and Mrs
Guttingen lived downstairs and we would hear them
talking sometimes in the evening and they were very
happy together too He had been a headwaiter and she
had worked as maid in the same hotel and they had
saved their money to buy this place They had a son




who was studying to be a headwaiter He was at a
hotel in Zurich Downstairs there was a parlor where
they sold wine and beer and sometimes in the evening
we would hear carts stop outside on the road and men
come up the steps to go in the parlor to drink wine

There was a box of wood in the hall outside the liv
ingroom and I kept up the fire from it But we did
not stay up very late We went to bed in the dark in
the big bedroom and when I was undressed I opened
the windows and saw the night and the cold stars and
the pine trees below the window and then got into bed
as fast as I could It was lovely in bed with the air so
cold and clear and the night outside the window We
slept well and if I woke in the night I knew it was from
only one cause and I would shift the feather bed over
very softly so that Catherine would not be wakened
and then go back to sleep again warm and with the
new lightness of thin covers The war seemed as far
away as the football games of some one elses college
But I knew from the papers that they were still fight
ing in the mountains because the snow would not come

Sometimes we walked down the mountain into Mon
treux There was a path went down the mountain but
it was steep and so usually we took the road and walked
down on the wide hard road between fields and then
below between the stone walls of the vineyards and on
down between the houses of the villages along the way
There were three villages  Chernex Fontanivent and
the other I forget Then along the road we passed an
old squarebuilt stone chateau on a ledge on the side of
the mountainside with the terraced fields of vines
each vine tied to a stick to hold it up the vines dry and
brown and the earth ready for the snow and the lake




down below flat and gray as steel The road went down
a long grade below the chateau and then turned to the
right and went down very steeply and paved with cob
bles into Montreux

We did not know any one in Montreux We walked
along beside the lake and saw the swans and the many
gulls and terns that flew up when you came close and
screamed while they looked down at the water Out on
the lake there were flocks of grebes small and dark
and leaving trails in the water when they swam In
the town we walked along the main street and looked
in the windows of the shops There were many big
hotels that were closed but most of the shops were open
and the people were very glad to see us There was a
fine coiffeurs place where Catherine went to have her
hair done The woman who ran it was very cheerful
and the only person we knew in Montreux While
Catherine was there I went up to a beer place and
drank dark Munich beer and read the papers I read
the Corriere delta Sera and the English and American
papers from Paris All the advertisements were blacked
out supposedly to prevent communication in that way
with the enemy The papers were bad reading Every
thing was going very badly everywhere I sat back in
the corner with a heavy mug of dark beer and an opened
glazedpaper package of pretzels and ate the pretzels for
the salty flavor and the good w r ay they made the beer
taste and read about disaster I thought Catherine
would come by but she did not come so I hung the pa
pers back on the rack paid for my beer and went up
the street to look for her The day was cold and dark
and wintry and the stone of the houses looked cold
Catherine was still in the hairdressers shop The
woman was waving her hair I sat in the little booth




and watched It was exciting to watch and Catherine
smiled and talked to me and my voice was a little thick
from being excited The tongs made a pleasant click
ing sound and I could see Catherine in three mirrors
and it was pleasant and warm in the booth Then the
woman put up Catherines hair and Catherine looked
in the mirror and changed it a little taking out and
putting in pins then stood up Im sorry to have
taken such a long time

Monsieur was very interested Were you not mon
sieur  the woman smiled

Yes I said

We went out and up the street It was cold and win
try and the wind was blowing Oh darling I love
you so I said

Dont we have a fine time Catherine said Look
Lets go some place and have beer instead of tea Its
very good for young Catherine It keeps her small

Young Catherine I said That loafer

Shes been very good Catherine said She makes
very little trouble The doctor says beer will be good
for me and keep her small

If you keep her small enough and shes a boy may
be he will be a jockey

I suppose if we really have this child we ought to
get married Catherine said We were in the beer
place at the corner table It was getting dark outside
It was still early but the day was dark and the dusk was
coming early

Lets get married now I said

No Catherine said Its too embarrassing now
I show too plainly I wont go before any one and be
married in this state

I wish wed gotten married




I suppose it would have been better But when
could we darling 

I dont know

I know one thing Im not going to be married in
this splendid matronly state

Youre not matronly

Oh yes I am darling The hairdresser asked me
if this was our first I lied and said no we had two
boys and two girls

When will we be married

Any time after Im thin again We want to have a
splendid wedding with every one thinking what a hand
some young couple

And youre not worried

Darling why should I be worried  The only time I
ever felt badly was when I felt like a whore in Milan
and that only lasted seven minutes and besides it was
the room furnishings Dont I make you a good wife

Youre a lovely wife

Then dont be too technical darling Ill marry
you as soon as Im thin again

All right

Do you think I ought to drink another beer The
doctor said I was rather narrow in the hips and its all
for the best if we keep young Catherine small

What else did he say I was worried

Nothing I have a wonderful bloodpressure dar
ling He admired my bloodpressure greatly

What did he say about you being too narrow in the
hips

Nothing Nothing at all He said I shouldnt
ski

Quite right

He said it was too late to start if Id never done it




before He said I could ski if I wouldnt fall down

Hes just a bighearted joker

Really he was very nice Well have him when the
baby comes

Did you ask him if you ought to get married 

No I told him wed been married four years You
see darling if I marry you Ill be an American and
any time were married under American law the child
is legitimate

Where did you find that out

In the New York World Almanac in the library

Youre a grand girl

anyway

All right Well go there

Now lets go up the mountain Should we Can
we get the M O B 

Theres a train a little after five




Lets get that

All right Ill drink one more beer first

When we went out to go up the street and climb the
stairs to the station it was very cold A cold wind was
coming down the Rhone valley There were lights in
the shop windows and we climbed the steep stone stair
way to the upper street then up another stairs to the
station The electric train was there waiting all the
lights on There was a dial that showed when it left
The clock hands pointed to ten minutes after five I
looked at the station clock It was five minutes after
As we got on board I saw the motorman and conductor
coming out of the station wineshop We sat down and
opened the window The train was electrically heated
and stuffy but fresh cold air came in through the win
dow

Are you tired Cat I asked

No I feel splendid

It isnt a long ride

I like the ride she said Dont worry about me
darling I feel fine

Snow did not come until three days before Christ
mas We woke one morning and it was snowing We
stayed in bed with the fire roaring in the stove and
watched the snow fall Mrs Guttingen took away the
breakfast trays and put more wood in the stove It
was a big snow storm She said it had started about
midnight I went to the window and looked out but
could not see across the road It was blowing and
snowing wildly I went back to bed and we lay and
talked

I wish I could ski Catherine said Its rotten not
to be able to ski




Well get a bobsled and come down the road
Thats no worse for you than riding in a car

Wont it be rough

We can see

I hope it wont be too rough

After a while well take a walk in the snow

Before lunch Catherine said so well have a
good appetite

Im always hungry

So am I

We went out in the snow but it was drifted so that
we could not walk far I went ahead and made a trail
down to the station but when we reached there we had
gone far enough The snow was blowing so we could
hardly see and we went into the little inn by the station
and swept each other off with a broom and sat on a
bench and had vermouths

It is a big storm the barmaid said

Yes

The snow is very late this year

Yes

Could I eat a chocolate bar Catherine asked Or
is it too close to lunch  Im always hungry

Go on and eat one I said

Ill take one with filberts Catherine said

They are very good the girl said I like them the
best

Ill have another vermouth I said

When we came out to start back up the road our
track was filled in by the snow There were only faint
indentations where the holes had been The snow blew
in our faces so we could hardly see We brushed off
and went in to have lunch Mr Guttingen served the
lunch



ji8 A FAREWELL TO ARMS

Tomorrow there will be skiing he said Do
you ski Mr Henry 

No But I want to learn

You will learn very easily My boy will be here
for Christmas and he will teach you

When we were sitting by the stove in the little room
after lunch looking out the window at the snow coming
down Catherine said Wouldnt you like to go on a
trip somewhere by yourself darling and be with men

No Why should I

I should think sometimes you would want to see
other people besides me

Do you want to see other people

I got out the chessboard and arranged the pieces

One time in the night I woke up and knew that
Catherine was awake too The moon was shining in
the window and made shadows on the bed from the
bars on the windowpanes

Are you awake sweetheart

thinking about things and watching Catherine sleeping
the moonlight on her face Then I went to sleep too



CHAPTER XXXIX

By the middle of January I had a beard and the
winter had settled into bright cold days and hard cold
nights We could walk on the roads again The snow
was packed hard and smooth by the haysleds and wood
sledges and the logs that were hauled down the moun
tain The snow lay over all the country down almost
to Montreux The mountains on the other side of the
lake were all white and the plain of the Rhone valley
was covered We took long walks on the other side of
the mountain to the Bains de lAlliaz Catherine wore
hobnailed boots and a cape and carried a stick with a
sharp steel point She did not look big with the cape
and we would not walk too fast but stopped and sat
on logs by the roadside to rest when she was tired

There was an inn in the trees at the Bains de lAlliaz
where the woodcutters stopped to drink and we sat
inside warmed by the stove and drank hot red wine
with spices and lemon in it They called it gliihwein and
it was a good thing to warm you and to celebrate with
The inn was dark and smoky inside and afterward
when you went out the cold air came sharply into your
lungs and numbed the edge of your nose as you in
haled We looked back at the inn with light coming
from the windows and the woodcutters horses stamp
ing and jerking their heads outside to keep warm
There was frost on the hairs of their muzzles and their
breathing made plumes of frost in the air Going up
the road toward home the road was smooth and slip
pery for a while and the ice orange from the horses
until the woodhauling track turned off Then the road





was cleanpacked snow and led through the woods and
twice coming home in the evening we saw foxes

It was a fine country and every time that we went
out it was fun

You have a splendid beard now Catherine said
It looks just like the woodcutters Did you see the
man with the tiny gold earrings

Hes a chamois hunter I said They wear them
because they say it makes them hear better

Really I dont believe it I think they wear them
to show they are chamois hunters Are there chamois
near here

Yes beyond the Dent de Jaman

It was fun seeing the fox

When he sleeps he wraps that tail around him to
keep warm

It must be a lovely feeling

I always wanted to have a tail like that Wouldnt
it be fun if we had brushes like a fox

It might be very difficult dressing

Wed have clothes made or live in a country where
it wouldnt make any difference

We live in a country where nothing makes any dif
ference Isnt it grand how we never see any one
You dont want to see people do you darling

No

Should we sit here just a minute Im a little bit
tired

We sat close together on the logs Ahead the road
went down through the forest

She wont come between us will she The little
brat

No We wont let her

How are we for money




We have plenty They honored the last sight
draft

Wont your family try and get hold of you now
they know youre in Switzerland

Probably Ill write them something

Havent you written them

No Only the sight draft

Thank God Im not your family

Ill send them a cable

Dont you care anything about them

I did but we quarrelled so much it wore itself out

I think Id like them Id probably like them very
much

Lets not talk about them or Ill start to worry
about them After a while I said Lets go on if
youre rested

Im rested

We went on down the road It was dark now and
the snow squeaked under our boots The night was dry

CHAPTER XL

We had a fine life We lived through the months of
January and February and the winter was very fine
and we were very happy There had been short thaws
when the wind blew warm and the snow softened and
the air felt like Spring but always the clear hard cold
had come again and the winter had returned In
March came the first break in the winter In the night
it started raining It rained on all morning and turned
the snow to slush and made the mountainside dismal
There were clouds over the lake and over the valley
It was raining high up the mountain Catherine wore
heavy overshoes and I wore Mr Guttingens rubber
boots and we walked to the station under an umbrella
through the slush and the running water that was
washing the ice of the roads bare to stop at the pub
before lunch for a vermouth Outside we could hear
the rain

Do you think we ought to move into town
What do you think Catherine asked
If the winter is over and the rain keeps up it wont
be fun up here How long is it before young Cath
erine 

About a month Perhaps a little more
We might go down and stay in Montreux
Why dont we go to Lausanne Thats where the
hospital is

All right But I thought maybe that was too big a
town

We can be as much alone in a bigger town and
Lausanne might be nice





When should we go

I dont care Whenever you want darling I dont
want to leave here if you dont want

Lets see how the weather turns out

It rained for three days The snow was all gone now
on the mountainside below the station The road was
a torrent of muddy snowwater It was too wet and
slushy to go out On the morning of the third day of
rain we decided to go down into town

That is all right Mr Henry Guttingen said
You do not have to give me any notice I did not
think you would want to stay now the bad weather is
come

We have to be near the hospital anyway on account
of Madame I said

I understand he said Will you come back some
time and stay with the little one

Yes if you would have room

In the Spring when it is nice you could come and
enjoy it We could put the little one and the nurse in
the big room that is closed now and you and Madame
could have your same room looking out over the lake

Ill write about coming I said We packed and
left on the train that went down after lunch Mr and
Mrs Guttingen came down to the station with us and
he hauled our baggage down on a sled through the
slush They stood beside the station in the rain wav
ing goodby

They were very sweet Catherine said

They were fine to us

We took the train to Lausanne from Montreux
Looking out the window toward where we had lived
you could not see the mountains for the clouds The




train stopped in Vevey then went on passing the lake
on one side and on the other the wet brown fields and
the bare woods and the wet houses We came into
Lausanne and went into a mediumsized hotel to stay
It was still raining as we drove through the streets and
into the carriage entrance of the hotel The concierge
with brass keys on his lapels the elevator the carpets
on the floors and the white washbowls with shining
fixtures the brass bed and the big comfortable bed
room all seemed very great luxury after the Guttin
gens The windows of the room looked out on a wet
garden with a wall topped by an iron fence Across
the street which sloped steeply was another hotel with
a similar wall and garden I looked out at the rain
falling in the fountain of the garden

Catherine turned on all the lights and commenced
unpacking I ordered a whiskey and soda and lay on
the bed and read the papers I had bought at the sta
tion It was March 191 8 and the German offensive
had started in France I drank the whiskey and soda
and read while Catherine unpacked and moved around
the room

You know what I have to get darling she said

What

Baby clothes There arent many people reach my
time without baby things

You can buy them

I know Thats what Ill do tomorrow Ill find
out what is necessary

You ought to know You were a nurse

But so few of the soldiers had babies in the hos
pitals

I did




She hit me with the pillow and spilled the whiskey
and soda

Ill order you another she said Im sorry I
spilled it

There wasnt much left Come on over to the bed

No I have to try and make this room look like
something

Like what

Like our home

Hang out the Allied flags

Oh shut up

Say it again

Shut up

You say it so cautiously I said As though you
didnt want to offend any one

I dont

Then come over to the bed

All right She came and sat on the bed I know
Im no fun for you darling Im like a big flourbarrel

No youre not Youre beautiful and youre sweet

Im just something very ungainly that youve mar
ried

No youre not Youre more beautiful all the time

But I will be thin again darling

Youre thin now

Youve been drinking

Just whiskey and soda

Theres another one coming she said And then
should we order dinner up here 

That will be good

Then we wont go out will we Well just stay in
tonight

And play I said

Ill drink some wine Catherine said It wont




hurt me Maybe we can get some of our old white
capri

I know we can I said Theyll have Italian wines
at a hotel this size

The waiter knocked at the door He brought the
whiskey in a glass with ice and beside the glass on a
tray a small bottle of soda

Thank you I said Put it down there Will you
please have dinner for two brought up here and two
bottles of dry white capri in ice

Do you wish to commence your dinner with soup

Do you want soup Cat

Please

Bring soup for one

Thank you sir He went out and shut the door
I went back to the papers and the war in the papers and
poured the soda slowly over the ice into the whiskey I
would have to tell them not to put ice in the whiskey
Let them bring the ice separately That way you could
tell how much whiskey there was and it would not sud
denly be too thin from the soda I would get a bottle
of whiskey and have them bring ice and soda That
was the sensible way Good whiskey was very pleasant
It was one of the pleasant parts of life

What are you thinking darling

About whiskey

What about whiskey

About how nice it is

Catherine made a face All right she said

We stayed at that hotel three weeks It was not
bad the diningroom was usually empty and very of
ten we ate in our room at night We walked in the




town and took the cogwheel railway down to Ouchy
and walked beside the lake The weather became quite
warm and it was like Spring We wished we were back
in the mountains but the Spring weather lasted only a
few days and then the cold rawness of the breakingup
of winter came again

Catherine bought the things she needed for the baby
up in the town I went to a gymnasium in the arcade
to box for exercise I usually went up there in the
morning while Catherine stayed late in bed On the
days of false Spring it was very nice after boxing and
taking a shower to walk along the streets smelling the
Spring in the air and stop at a cafe to sit and watch
the people and read the paper and drink a vermouth
then go down to the hotel and have lunch with Cathe
rine The professor at the boxing gymnasium wore
mustaches and was very precise and jerky and went
all to pieces if you started after him But it was pleas
ant in the gym There was good air and light and I
worked quite hard skipping rope shadowboxing do
ing abdominal exercises lying on the floor in a patch
of sunlight that came through the open window and
occasionally scaring the professor when we boxed I
could not shadowbox in front of the narrow long
mirror at first because it looked so strange to see a
man with a beard boxing But finally I just thought
it was funny I wanted to take off the beard as soon
as I started boxing but Catherine did not want me to

Sometimes Catherine and I went for rides out in
the country in a carriage It was nice to ride when
the days were pleasant and we found two good places
where we could ride out to eat Catherine could not
walk very far now and I loved to ride out along the
country roads with her When there was a good day




we had a splendid time and we never had a bad time
We knew the baby was very close now and it gave us
both a feeling as though something were hurrying us
and we could not lose any time together



CHAPTER XLI

One morning I awoke about three oclock hearing
Catherine stirring in the bed

Are you all right Cat

Ive been having some pains darling

Regularly

No not very

If you have them at all regularly well go to the
hospital

I was very sleepy and went back to sleep A little
while later I woke again

Maybe youd better call up the doctor Catherine
said I think maybe this is it

I went to the phone and called the doctor How
often are the pains coming he asked

How often are they coming Cat

I should think every quarter of an hour

You should go to the hospital then the doctor
said I will dress and go there right away myself

I hung up and called the garage near the station to
send up a taxi No one answered the phone for a long
time Then I finally got a man who promised to send
up a taxi at once Catherine was dressing Her bag
was all packed with the things she would need at the
hospital and the baby things Outside in the hall I
rang for the elevator There was no answer I went
downstairs There was no one downstairs except the
nightwatchman I brought the elevator up myself
put Catherines bag in it she stepped in and we went
down The nightwatchman opened the door for us
and we sat outside on the stone slabs beside the stairs





down to the driveway and waited for the taxi The
night was clear and the stars were out Catherine was
very excited

Im so glad its started she said Now in a little
while it will be all over

Youre a good brave girl

Im not afraid I wish the taxi would come
though

We heard it coming up the street and saw its head
lights It turned into the driveway and I helped
Catherine in and the driver put the bag up in front

Drive to the hospital I said

We went out of the driveway and started up the hill

At the hospital we went in and I carried the bag
There was a woman at the desk who wrote down
Catherines name age address relatives and religion
in a book She said she had no religion and the wo
man drew a line in the space after that word She
gave her name as Catherine Henry

I will take you up to your room she said We
went up in an elevator The woman stopped it and we
stepped out and followed her down a hall Catherine
held tight to my arm

This is the room the woman said Will you
please undress and get into bed  Here is a nightgown
for you to wear

I have a nightgown Catherine said

It is better for you to wear this nightgown the
woman said

I went outside and sat on a chair in the hallway

You can come in now the woman said from the
doorway Catherine was lying in the narrow bed wear
ing a plain squarecut nightgown that looked as though
it were made of rough sheeting She smiled at me




Im having fine pains now she said The woman
was holding her wrist and timing the pains with a
watch

That was a big one Catherine said I saw it on
her face

Wheres the doctor I asked the woman

Hes lying down sleeping He will be here when
he is needed

I must do something for Madame now the nurse
said Would you please step out again

I went out into the hall It was a bare hall with two
windows and closed doors all down the corridor It
smelled of hospital I sat on the chair and looked at
the floor and prayed for Catherine

You can come in the nurse said I went in

Hello darling Catherine said

How is it

They are coming quite often now Her face drew
up Then she smiled

That was a real one Do you want to put your
hand on my back again nurse

If it helps you the nurse said

You go away darling Catherine said Go out
and get something to eat I may do this for a long
time the nurse says

The first labor is usually protracted the nurse
said

Please go out and get something to eat Catherine
said Im fine really

Ill stay awhile I said

The pains came quite regularly then slackened off
Catherine was very excited When the pains were bad
she called them good ones When they started to fall
off she was disappointed and ashamed




You go out darling she said I think you are
just making me selfconscious Her face tied up
There That was better I so want to be a good wife
and have this child without any foolishness Please
go and get some breakfast darling and then come
back I wont miss you Nurse is splendid to me

You have plenty of time for breakfast the nurse
said

Ill go then Goodby sweet

Goodby Catherine said and have a fine break
fast for me too

Where can I get breakfast I asked the nurse

Theres a cafe down the street at the square she
said It should be open now

Outside it was getting light I walked down the
empty street to the cafe There was a light in the win
dow I went in and stood at the zinc bar and an old
man served me a glass of white wine and a brioche
The brioche was yesterdays I dipped it in the wine
and then drank a glass of coffee

What do you do at this hour the old man asked

My wife is in labor at the hospital

So I wish you good luck

Give me another glass of wine

He poured it from the bottle slopping it over a little
so some ran down on the zinc I drank this glass paid
and went out Outside along the street were the refuse
cans from the houses waiting for the collector A dog
was nosing at one of the cans

What do you want I asked and looked in the can
to see if there was anything I could pull out for him
there was nothing on top but coffeegrounds dust and
some dead flowers

There isnt anything dog I said The dog crossed




the street I went up the stairs in the hospital to the
floor Catherine was on and down the hall to her room
I knocked on the door There was no answer I opened
the door the room was empty except for Catherines
bag on a chair and her dressinggown hanging on a
hook on the wall I went out and down the hall look
ing for somebody I found a nurse

Where is Madame Henry 

A lady has just gone to the delivery room

Where is it

I will show you

She took me down to the end of the hall The door
of the room was partly open I could see Catherine
lying on a table covered by a sheet The nurse was on
one side and the doctor stood on the other side of the
table beside some cylinders The doctor held a rubber
mask attached to a tube in one hand

I will give you a gown and you can go in the
nurse said Come in here please

She put a white gown on me and pinned it at the
neck in back with a safety pin

Now you can go in she said I went into the room

Hello darling Catherine said in a strained voice
Im not doing much

You are Mr Henry the doctor asked

Yes How is everything going doctor

Things are going very well the doctor said We
came in here where it is easy to give gas for the pains

I want it now Catherine said The doctor placed
the rubber mask over her face and turned a dial and I
watched Catherine breathing deeply and rapidly Then
she pushed the mask away The doctor shut off the
petcock

That wasnt a very big one I had a very big one




a while ago The doctor made me go clear out didnt
you doctor  Her voice was strange It rose on the
word doctor

The doctor smiled

I want it again Catherine said She held the rub
ber tight to her face and breathed fast I heard her
moaning a little Then she pulled the mask away and
smiled

That was a big one she said That was a very
big one Dont you worry darling You go away Go
have another breakfast

ID stay I said

We had gone to the hospital about three oclock in the
morning At noon Catherine was still in the delivery
room The pains had slackened again She looked very
tired and worn now but she was still cheerful

Im not any good darling she said Im so sorry
I thought I would do it very easily Now  theres
one   she reached out her hand for the mask and held
it over her face The doctor moved the dial and
watched her In a little while it was over

It wasnt much Catherine said She smiled Im
a fool about the gas Its wonderful

Well get some for the home I said

There one comes Catherine said quickly The doc
tor turned the dial and looked at his watch

What is the interval now I asked

About a minute

Dont you want lunch

I will have something pretty soon he said

You must have something to eat doctor Cathe
rine said Im so sorry I go on so long Couldnt my
husband give me the gas




If you wish the doctor said You turn it to the
numeral two

I see I said There was a marker on a dial that
turned with a handle

1 want it now Catherine said She held the mask
tight to her face I turned the dial to number two and
when Catherine put down the mask I turned it off It
was very good of the doctor to let me do something

Did you do it darling Catherine asked She
stroked my wrist

Sure

Youre so lovely She was a little drunk from
the gas

I will eat from a tray in the next room the doc
tor said You can call me any moment While the
time passed I watched him eat then after a while I
saw that he was lying down and smoking a cigarette
Catherine was getting very tired

Do you think Ill ever have this baby she asked

Yes of course you will

I try as hard as I can I push down but it goes
away There it comes Give it to me

At two oclock I went out and had lunch There
were a few men in the cafe sitting with coffee and
glasses of kirsch or marc on the tables I sat down at
a table Can I eat I asked the waiter

It is past time for lunch

Isnt there anything for all hours

You can have choucroute

Give me choucroute and beer

A demi or a bock

A light demi

The waiter brought a dish of sauerkraut with a slice




of ham over the top and a sausage buried in the hot
winesoaked cabbage I ate it and drank the beer I was
very hungry I watched the people at the tables in the
cafe At one table they were playing cards Two men
at the table next me were talking and smoking The
cafe was full of smoke The zinc bar where I had
breakfasted had three people behind it now the old
man a plump woman in a black dress who sat behind
a counter and kept track of everything served to the
tables and a boy in an apron I wondered how many
children the woman had and what it had been like

When I was through with the choucroute I went
back to the hospital The street was all clean now
There were no refuse cans out The day was cloudy
but the sun was trying to come through I rode up
stairs in the elevator stepped out and went down the
hall to Catherines room where I had left my white
gown I put it on and pinned it in back at the neck
I looked in the glass and saw myself looking like a fake
doctor with a beard I went down the hall to the de
livery room The door was closed and I knocked No
one answered so I turned the handle and went in The
doctor sat by Catherine The nurse was doing some
thing at the other end of the room

Here is your husband the doctor said

Oh darling I have the most wonderful doctor
Catherine said in a very strange voice Hes been
telling me the most wonderful story and when the pain
came too badly he put me all the way out Hes won
derful Youre wonderful doctor

Youre drunk I said

I know it Catherine said But you shouldnt say
it Then Give it to me Give it to me She
clutched hold of the mask and breathed short and deep




pantingly making the respirator click Then she gave
a long sigh and the doctor reached with his left hand
and lifted away the mask

That was a very big one Catherine said Her voice
was very strange Im not going to die now darling
Im past where I was going to die Arent you glad

Dont you get in that place again

I wont Im not afraid of it though I wont die
darling

You will not do any such foolishness the doctor
said You would not die and leave your husband

Oh no I wont die I wouldnt die Its silly to
die There it comes Give it to me

After a while the doctor said You will go out Mr
Henry for a few moments and I will make an ex
amination

He wants to see how I am doing Catherine said
You can come back afterward darling cant he doc
tor

Yes said the doctor I will send word when he
can come back

I went out the door and down the hall to the room
where Catherine was to be after the baby came I
sat in a chair there ana looked at the room I had the
paper in my coat that I had bought when I went out
for lunch and I read it It was beginning to be dark
outside and I turned the light on to read After a while
I stopped reading and turned off the light and watched
it get dark outside I wondered why the doctor did
not send for me Maybe it was better I was away
He probably wanted me away for a while I looked
at my watch If he did not send for me in ten minutes
I would go down anyway

Poor poor dear Cat And this was the price you




paid for sleeping together This was the end of the
trap This was what people got for loving each other
Thank God for gas anyway What must it have been
like before there were anaesthetics Once it started
they were in the millrace Catherine had a good time
in the time of pregnancy It wasnt bad She was
hardly ever sick She was not awfully uncomfortable
until toward the last So now they got her in the end
You never got away with anything Get away hell
It would have been the same if we had been married
fifty times And what if she should die She wont
die People dont die in childbirth nowadays That
was what all husbands thought Yes but what if she
should die She wont die Shes just having a bad
time The initial labor is usually protracted Shes
only having a bad time Afterward wed say what a
bad time and Catherine would say it wasnt really so
bad But what if she should die She cant die Yes
but what if she should die She cant I tell you Dont
be a fool Its just a bad time Its just nature giv
ing her hell Its only the first labor which is almost
always protracted Yes but what if she should die
She cant die Why would she die What reason is
there for her to die Theres just a child that has to
be born the byproduct of good nights in Milan It
makes trouble and is born and then you look after it
and get fond of it maybe But what if she should die
She wont die But what if she should die She
wont Shes all right But what if she should die
She cant die But what if she should die Hey what
about that What if she should die

The doctor came into the room

How does it go doctor

It doesnt go he said




What do you mean

Just that I made an examination   He detailed
the result of the examination Since then Ive waited
to see But it doesnt go

What do you advise

There are two things Either a high forceps de
livery which can tear and be quite dangerous besides
being possibly bad for the child and a Caesarean

What is the danger of a Caesarean What if she
should die 

It should be no greater than the danger of an or
dinary delivery

Would you do it yourself

Yes I would need possibly an hour to get things
ready and to get the people I would need Perhaps a
little less

What do you think

I would advise a Caesarean operation If it were
my wife I would do a Caesarean

What are the after effects

There are none There is only the scar

What about infection 

The danger is not so great as in a high forceps de
livery

What if you just went on and did nothing

You would have to do something eventually Mrs
Henry is already losing much of her strength The
sooner we operate now the safer

Operate as soon as you can I said

I will go and give the instructions

I went into the delivery room The nurse was with
Catherine who lay on the table big under the sheet
looking very pale and tired

Did you tell him he could do it she asked




Yes

Isnt that grand Now it will be all over in an hour
Im almost done darling Im going all to pieces
Please give me that It doesnt work Oh it doesnt
work

Breathe deeply

I am Oh it doesnt work any more It doesnt
work

Get another cylinder I said to the nurse

That is a new cylinder

Im just a fool darling Catherine said But it
doesnt work any more She began to cry Oh I
wanted so to have this baby and not make trouble and
now Im all done and all gone to pieces and it doesnt
work Oh darling it doesnt work at all I dont
care if I die if it will only stop Oh please darling
please make it stop There it comes Oh Oh Oh
She breathed sobbingly in the mask It doesnt work
It doesnt work It doesnt work Dont mind me
darling Please dont cry Dont mind me Im just
gone all to pieces You poor sweet I love you so and
Ill be good again Ill be good this time Cant they
give me something If they could only give me some
thing

Ill make it work Ill turn it all the way

Give it to me now

I turned the dial all the way and as she breathed
hard and deep her hand relaxed on the mask I shut
off the gas and lifted the mask She came back from
a long way away

That was lovely darling Oh youre so good to
me

You be brave because I cant do that all the time
It might kill you




Im not brave any more darling Im all broken
Theyve broken me I know it now

 Everybody is that way

But its awful They just keep it up till they break
you

In an hour it will be over

Isnt that lovely Darling I wont die will I

No I promise you wont

Because I dont want to die and leave you but I
get so tired of it and I feel Im going to die

Nonsense Everybody feels that

Sometimes I know Im going to die

You wont You cant

But what if I should

I wont let you

Give it to me quick Give it to meT

Then afterward I wont die I wont let myself
die

Of course you wont

Youll stay with me

Not to watch it

No just to be there

Sure Ill be there all the time

Youre so good to me There give it to me Give
me some more Its not working 7

I turned the dial to three and then four I wished
the doctor would come back I was afraid of the num
bers above two

Finally a new doctor came in with two nurses and
they lifted Catherine onto a wheeled stretcher and we
started down the hall The stretcher went rapidly down
the hall and into the elevator where every one had to
crowd against the wall to make room then up then




an open door and out of the elevator and down the
hall on rubber wheels to the operating room I did
not recognize the doctor with his cap and mask on
There was another doctor and more nurses

Theyve got to give me something Catherine said
Theyve got to give me something Oh please doc
tor give me enough to do some good 

One of the doctors put a mask over her face and I
looked through the door and saw the bright small am
phitheatre of the operating room

You can go in the other door and sit up there a
nurse said to me There were benches behind a rail
that looked down on the white table and the lights I
looked at Catherine The mask was over her face and
she was quiet now They wheeled the stretcher for
ward I turned away and walked down the hall Two
nurses were hurrying toward the entrance to the gal
lery

Its a Caesarean one said Theyre going to do a
Caesarean

The other one laughed Were just in time Arent
we lucky They went in the door that led to the
gallery

Another nurse came along She was hurrying too

You go right in there Go right in she said

Im staying outside

She hurried in I walked up and down the hall I
was afraid to go in I looked out the window It was
dark but in the light from the window I could see it
was raining I went into a room at the far end of the
hall and looked at the labels on bottles in a glass case
Then I came out and stood in the empty hall and
watched the door of the operating room

A doctor came out followed by a nurse He held




something in his two hands that looked like a freshly
skinned rabbit and hurried across the corridor with it
and in through another door I went down to the door
he had gone into and found them in the room doing
things to a newborn child The doctor held him up for
me to see He held him by the heels and slapped him

Is he all right 

Hes magnificent Hell weigh five kilos

I had no feeling for him He did not seem to have
anything to do with me I felt no feeling of father
hood

Arent you proud of your son the nurse asked
They were washing him and wrapping him in some
thing I saw the little dark face and dark hand but I
did not see him move or hear him cry The doctor was
doing something to him again He looked upset

No I said He nearly killed his mother

It isnt the little darlings fault Didnt you want
a boy

No I said The doctor was busy with him He
held him up by the feet and slapped him I did not
wait to see it I went out in the hall I could go in
now and see I went in the door and a little way down
the gallery The nurses who were sitting at the rail
motioned for me to come down where they were I
shook my head I could see enough where I was

I thought Catherine was dead She looked dead
Her face was gray the part of it that I could see
Down below under the light the doctor was sewing
up the great long forcepspread thickedged wound
Another doctor in a mask gave the anaesthetic Two
nurses in masks handed things It looked like a draw
ing of the Inquisition I knew as I watched I could
have watched it all but I was glad I hadnt I do not




think I could have watched them cut but I watched the
wound closed into a high welted ridge with quick skil
fullooking stitches like a cobblers and was glad When
the wound was closed I went out into the hall and
walked up and down again After a while the doctor
came out

How is she

She is all right Did you watch

He looked tired

I saw you sew up The incision looked very long

You thought so

Yes Will that scar flatten out

Oh yes

After a while they brought out the wheeled stretcher
and took it very rapidly down the hallway to the ele
vator I went along beside it Catherine was moan
ing Downstairs they put her in the bed in her room
I sat in a chair at the foot of the bed There was a
nurse in the room I got up and stood by the bed It
was dark in the room Catherine put out her hand
Hello darling she said Her voice was very weak
and tired

Hello you sweet

What sort of baby was it

Sh  dont talk the nurse said

A boy Hes long and wide and dark

Is he all right

Yes I said Hes fine

I saw the nurse look at me strangely

Im awfully tired Catherine said And I hurt
like hell Are you all right darling

Im fine Dont talk

You were lovely to me Oh darling I hurt dread
fully What does he look like




He looks like a skinned rabbit with a puckeredup
oldmans face

You must go out the nurse said Madame
Henry must not talk

Til be outside I said

Go and get something to eat

No Ill be outside I kissed Catherine She
was very gray and weak and tired

May I speak to you I said to the nurse She
came out in the hall with me I walked a little way
down the hall

Whats the matter with the baby I asked

Didnt you know

No

He wasnt alive

He was dead

They couldnt start him breathing The cord was
caught around his neck or something

So hes dead

Yes Its such a shame He was such a fine big
boy I thought you knew

No I said You better go back in with Ma
dame

I sat down on the chair in front of a table where
there were nurses reports hung on clips at the side and
looked out of the window I could see nothing but
the dark and the rain falling across the light from the
window So that was it The baby was dead That
was why the doctor looked so tired But why had they
acted the way they did in the room with him They
supposed he would come around and start breathing
probably I had no religion but I knew he ought to
have been baptized But what if he never breathed at




all He hadnt He had never been alive Except in
Catherine Id felt him kick there often enough But
I hadnt for a week Maybe he was choked all the time
Poor little kid I wished the hell Id been choked like
that No I didnt Still there would not be all this dying
to go through Now Catherine would die That was
what you did You died You did not know what it
was about You never had time to learn They threw
you in and told you the rules and the first time they
caught you off base they killed you Or they killed
you gratuitously like Aymo Or gave you the syphi
lis like Rinaldo But they killed you in the end You
could count on that Stay around and they would kill
you

Once in camp I put a log on top of the fire and it
was full of ants As it commenced to burn the ants
swarmed out and went first toward the centre where
the fire was  then turned back and ran toward the end
When there were enough on the end they fell off into
the fire Some got out their bodies burnt and flattened
and went off not knowing where they were going But
most of them went toward the fire and then back to
ward the end and swarmed on the cool end and finally
fell off into the fire I remember thinking at the time
that it was the end of the world and a splendid chance
to be a messiah and lift the log off the fire and throw
it out where the ants could get off onto the ground
But I did not do anything but throw a tin cup of water
on the log so that I would have the cup empty to put
whiskey in before I added water to it I think the cup
of water on the burning log only steamed the ants

So now I sat out in the hall and waited to hear how
Catherine was The nurse did not come out so after a
while I went to the door and opened it very softly and




looked in I could not see at first because there was a
bright light in the hall and it was dark in the room
Then I saw the nurse sitting by the bed and Cathe
rines head on a pillow and she all flat under the sheet
The nurse put her finger to her lips then stood up and
came to the door

How is she I asked

Shes all right the nurse said You should go
and have your supper and then come back if you wish

I went down the hall and then down the stairs and
out the door of the hospital and down the dark street
in the rain to the cafe It was brightly lighted inside
and there were many people at the tables I did not
see a place to sit and a waiter came up to me and took
my wet coat and hat and showed me a place at a table
across from an elderly man who was drinking beer and
reading the evening paper I sat down and asked the
waiter what the plat du jour was

Veal stew  but it is finished

What can I have to eat

Ham and eggs eggs with cheese or choucroute

I had choucroute this noon I said

Thats true he said Thats true You ate chou
croute this noon He was a middleaged man with a
bald top to his head and his hair slicked over it He
had a kind face

What do you want Ham and eggs or eggs with
cheese

Ham and eggs I said and beer

A demiblonde

Yes I said

I remembered he said You took a demiblonde
this noon

I ate the ham and eggs and drank the beer The ham




and eggs were in a round dish  the ham underneath
and the eggs on top It was very hot and at the first
mouthful I had to take a drink of beer to cool my
mouth I was hungry and I asked the waiter for an
other order I drank several glasses of beer I was
not thinking at all but read the paper of the man op
posite me It was about the break through on the Brit
ish front When he realized I was reading the back of
his paper he folded it over I thought of asking the
waiter for a paper but I could not concentrate It
was hot in the cafe and the air was bad Many of the
people at the tables knew one another There were sev
eral card games going on The waiters were busy
bringing drinks from the bar to the tables Two men
came in and could find no place to sit They stood op
posite the table where I was I ordered another beer
I was not ready to leave yet It was too soon to go
back to the hospital I tried not to think and to be
perfectly calm The men stood around but no one was
leaving so they went out I drank another beer There
was quite a pile of saucers now on the table in front of
me The man opposite me had taken off his spectacles
put them away in a case folded his paper and put it
in his pocket and now sat holding his liqueur glass and
looking out at the room Suddenly I knew I had to
get back I called the waiter paid the reckoning got
into my coat put on my hat and started out the door
I walked through the rain up to the hospital

Upstairs I met the nurse coming down the hall

I just called you at the hotel she said Some
thing dropped inside me

What is wrong

Mrs Henry has had a hemorrhage

Can I go in




No not yet The doctor is with her

Is it dangerous

It is very dangerous The nurse went into the
room and shut the door I sat outside in the hall
Everything was gone inside of me I did not think
I could not think I knew she was going to die and
I prayed that she would not Dont let her die Oh
God please dont let her die Ill do anything for you
if you wont let her die Please please please dear
God dont let her die Dear God dont let her die
Please please please dont let her die God please
make her not die Ill do anything you say if you dont
let her die You took the baby but dont let her die
That was all right but dont let her die Please please
dear God dont let her die

The nurse opened the door and motioned with her
finger for me to come I followed her into the room
Catherine did not look up when I came in I went over
to the side of the bed The doctor was standing by the
bed on the opposite side Catherine looked at me and
smiled I bent down over the bed and started to cry

Poor darling Catherine said very softly She
looked gray

Youre all right Cat I said Youre going to be
all right

Im going to die she said then waited and said
I hate it

I took her hand

Dont touch me she said I let go of her hand
She smiled Poor darling You touch me all you
want

Youll be all right Cat I know youll be all right

I meant to write you a letter to have if anything
happened but I didnt do it




Do you want me to get a priest or any one to come
and see you

Just you she said Then a little later Im not
afraid I just hate it

You must not talk so much the doctor said

All right Catherine said

Do you want me to do anything Cat Can I get
you anything

Catherine smiled No Then a little later You
wont do our things with another girl or say the same
things will you

Never

I want you to have girls though

I dont want them

You are talking too much the doctor said Mr
Henry must go out He can come back again later
You are not going to die You must not be silly

All right Catherine said Ill come and stay with
you nights she said It was very hard for her to
talk

Please go out of the room the doctor said You
cannot talk Catherine winked at me her face gray
Ill be right outside I said

Dont worry darling Catherine said Im not a
bit afraid Its just a dirty trick

You dear brave sweet

I waited outside in the hall I waited a long time
The nurse came to the door and came over to me Im
afraid Mrs Henry is very ill she said Im afraid
for her

Is she dead

No but she is unconscious

It seems she had one hemorrhage after another
They couldnt stop it I went into the room and stayed




with Catherine until she died She was unconscious
all the time and it did not take her very long to die

Outside the room in the hall I spoke to the doctor
is there anything I can do tonight 

No There is nothing to do Can I take you to your
hotel

No thank you I am going to stay here a while 

I know there is nothing to say I cannot tell
you 

No I said Theres nothing to say

Goodnight he said I cannot take you to your
hotel

No thank you

It was the only thing to do he said The opera
tion proved 

I do not want to talk about it I said

I would like to take you to your hotel

No thank you

He went down the hall I went to the door of the
room

You cant come in now one of the nurses said

Yes I can I said

You cant come in yet

You get out I said The other one too

But after I had got them out and shut the door and
turned off the light it wasnt any good It was like say
ing goodby to a statue After a while I went out and
left the hospital and walked back to the hotel in the rain

The End
